Rockin' in the U.S.A
Hey! R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A... One for each of you

Have fun
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A
Yeah, yeah Rockin' in the U.S.A
There you go

Now, doesn't that just lift your spirits
Let's give another big hand for the Hawkins High Marching Band
I hope you're all having a good time tonight
Are you having a good time
I can't hear you
I want you to know that we spared no expense to provide you with the very best entertainment that money can buy
Keep your arms inside
Uh-oh! Dad can't get out now
Why do you two enjoy torturing me
Because it's fun
Yeah, Dad, 'cause it's fun

Oh, boy
Hoo
But enough of me blabbering
Who here wants to see some fireworks
Come on, now, you can do better than that
Uh, why are we stopping
Because I slipped Jimmy a five
You what
Come on, these are the best seats in the house
The best seats in the house

Happy Fourth of July

That was pretty, wasn't it
Mom, the trees
What, baby
The trees are moving
Why are you looking at the trees, baby
The fireworks. Look at the fireworks
That was a big one, wasn't it
He said he was building something
That it was all for me
Building something... Is he talking about the flayed
He must be
So, he's building an army, just like we thought
Yeah, but he's not building this army to spread
He's building it to stop Eleven
Last year, El closed the gate on him
I have a feeling that really pissed him off
Like, royally
And the Mind Flayer now knows that she's the only thing that can stop him
But if she's out of the way Game over
He also said he was gonna kill all of you
Yeah, well, that's nice

It's just the fireworks
Billy... When he told you this, it was here, in this room
He knows we're here
Jesus, slow down
Yeah, what is this, like, the Indy 500
It's the Indy 300
No, dingus, it's 500
It's 300
Let's say a million
What is wrong with them

Dustin, watch out

You guys all right back there
They're fine
Come on. We gotta go, now
Come on! Get out

Ow
We're coming
Here goes nothin'
This sucks
Hey! You look like you're surfing
Surfing! Yeah
They seem drunk
Why would they be drunk
I'm a natural! Check it out
Whoop
Wipeout
He's burning up
You're burning up
One sec, one sec. Steve, Steve
God, no
His pupils are super dilated
Maybe he's drugged
Ugh. Boop
Steve, are you drugged
How many times, Dad
I don't do drugs. It's only marijuana
This isn't funny, okay
I need to know what they did to you
Are you gonna die on us
Boop
We all die, my strange little child friend
It's just a matter of how... and when
They're gonna be looking for us up there, so I need you to tell me where you parked your car
Oh, can we make a pit stop at the food court
I would kill for a hot dog on a stick

All right. Yeah, food
Yes, you can have as much food as you want, but only if you tell me where your car is parked
Uh-oh
The car's off the board

They took the keys
The Russians, they took the keys
Like, forever ago
That's a bummer, right
Oh, my God, that tastes so good. Ah
Steve, can you taste the air
I taste it! I taste it

Shit! Come on! Come on
Stop right there
Okay, okay, okay! Woo
Why are we running
Yeah. That's good like that
Hey, get away from the windows
It's close
Where'd it go


Pull
Nancy, shoot it
Come on! Lucas
El! El, you okay

Come on, come on, go

Hurry up! Come on
Everybody out
Go, come on
Go, go, go, go


Get in. Right here
Drive! Drive

Just trust me
All clear
Doc
What did I tell you
Eighty-eight miles per hour
The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1:20... You two, sit
No, no, no! These seats are too close
Dude, these seats blow
Then don't watch the movie
We wanna watch it
Then watch it

Sorry
Whatever you do, don't... go... anywhere
Fine, Dad
The appropriate question is "When the hell are they?"
You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler
Sorry. Sorry
I sent him... into the future
Okay, it's official
I'm never having kids
What are we doing here
We're laying low
Cooling off
Like Oswald
Oswald was found in a theater and shot to death
A week later
The point is, his plan didn't work
Only because it was a setup
He was just a patsy
Tell me you're joking
We need to get outta here
All right, you watch Tweedledee and Tweedledum
Make sure they don't go anywhere

To find us a ride
Look out
Doc... What's happening
I have no idea
Are you telling me that you built a time machine... What's he saying
He's showing me the location of the key to turn off the machine
Sorry, "keys." Two keys
Two-man rule
Yeah, two men, two keys, like a... nuclear launch
But, uh, to retrieve the keys, there is a vault
And to open the vault, you need to enter Planck's constant
Planck's what
Planck's constant
It's a very famous number
All right, so we get the keys, and then we turn the machine off
That's what he says
All right, well, that shouldn't be too hard. We can do this
Joyce, did you hear the part where he said the place was like an impenetrable fortress
Yeah, but there has to be a way in
Yeah, there is. Our military
Who are coming
Well, we don't know that anymore because you yelled at them like it was a parent-teacher conference, and then you hung up on them, so we don't know what the hell's going on, because now we're Wait, wait, what are we do -- Oh
Wait, that's right
We're on our way to rescue our children from the big, bad Fourth of July celebration
You know what, if you can't handle this, then just turn around and drop me off first
What are you gonna do
You gonna walk back to Hawkins
I will do anything if it gets me away from you
Children! Children! Children
This interminable bickering was amusing at first, but it's getting very stale and we've still got a long drive ahead of us
So, why don't you two cut the horseshit and get to the part where you admit your sexual feelings for one another
You are way off base, buddy
Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me
Yes, yes, he's a brute. I know
Probably reminds you of a bad relationship, and, gosh, you'd really like a nice man to settle down with, but, admit it, you're real curious to know what he's like in the sack
And you. Ha
Well, you're just a big manbaby who'd rather act tough than show his true feelings, because the last time you opened your heart, you got hurt

And now, rather than admit these feelings, you're dancing around one another with this mind-numbing and frankly boorish mating ritual
So, please, for my sake, either quit your bickering, or pull over, tear off those clothes, and get it over with already
What was that
I told them they should have sex
They have not had sex

Oh! Oh
Okay, get her down

Lemme see

What -- What -- Hey, what are you doing
I'm cleaning the wound
No, first, we need to stop the bleeding, then clean, then disinfect, then bandage
I skateboard. Trust me
Mike, hold this
Keep the pressure on it, nice and firm, okay
We're gonna need water, soap


Does any of this help
Go get me a washcloth and a bowl
A bowl
Lucas
What did that thing look like to you
Like that thing in the hospital, only bigger
Yeah, a lot bigger
Like, Tom and Bruce, they merged to become one, right
And -- And Driscoll kept saying how she needed to go back to the source Wait, you think Driscoll's in there

And -- And -- And maybe Heather and Janet, too, and God knows who else
I don't know how we're gonna kill this thing, but if we do We kill all the flayed
And... we end this
All I know is... we need El
Bowl... Bowl... Bowl... Why wouldn't it be with the cereal
What else do you use a bowl for
I -- I don't know
Satan's Baby
You ever shot one of these suckers
No. Is it sweet
That's an understatement
That doesn't look like a bowl
Nah, it's way better
There is a reason this warning label says "18 or older."
This sucker is filled with 150 grains of black powder
AKA gunpowder
Strap two of these together, and it's bigger than an M-80
Five of them, we've got ourselves a stick of dynamite
You wanna kill that thing with fireworks
Do you have a better idea
Uh, yeah. Eleven
Against that thing
She's gonna need some backup

Hold this
Does that hurt
Uh, not bad
You're gonna have an awesome scar
You'll look even more badass
Bitchin'
Yeah, bitchin'
El... Yeah
I've been meaning to tell you something
It's just, being broken up, it's been hard
And... I like that you and Max are friends now
It's just, I was jealous at first, and -- and angry
And that's why I said all that stupid stuff
And it's like I wanted you all to myself
And now I realize how unfair that is
And selfish. And, like... I'm sorry
I just, like, I've never felt like this, you know, with anyone before... and... You know, they do say it makes you crazy
What makes you crazy
You never -- You never heard that term... You know, like the phrase, like... "blank makes you crazy," like the word... "Girlfriends"
No, no, no, no, not -- not girlfriends
"Boyfriends."
No! No, no, not boyfriends either
It's like -- It's like a feeling or... A feeling... Yeah, like something... Like, old people say it to each other sometimes
Old people
What I wanna say is... that I just... I know that I I repeat... this is a code red


Oh, my God, you have to listen
I know I've been MIA, and I'm sorry, it's not because I'm mad
I mean, I actually was mad, but it's also because I was trapped underground in a secret Russian base
Dustin, you're going way too fast

I know that sounds insane, but the Russians have infiltrated Hawkins
The goddamn Russians
And now -- they're using to open the gate
Dustin, you're -- you're breaking up
And now they're after us and we don't have a way out of here, so I need you to come and get us
Can Nancy drive
Dustin, you're cutting out
Dustin, you there
Mike? Mike, do you copy
Dustin Shit! Not now. Please, not now. Mike

Do you have any batteries? Double-A
Why would I have batteries
I always carry batteries
Then what's the problem
I need eight
Eight
Shit. Guess we'll have to go to plan B
Plan B? What's plan B
Where... are they
That's amazing
So, like, I wasn't totally focused in there or anything, but... I'm pretty sure... that mom was trying to bang her son
Wait, wait, the hot chick was Alex P. Keaton's mom
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
But they're the same age
No, but he went back in time
Then why is it called Back to the Future
He has to go back to the future because he's in the past
So, the future is actually the present, which is his time
Wh... What
No, no, it's my turn. You've had enough


You gotta check this out
Check this... This... The ceiling, it's beautiful
Oh, wow
Stay here, go over the plans with Smirnoff
I can help look
No, you'll scare the children
Jim, if this is about earlier Stay put, Freud
You hear me? Stay put
You know, say what you will about Kline, he certainly knows how to throw a party
I'm sorry about him, by the way
Who, Larry
No, Murray
He's a sick individual who likes to get under people's skin
So, let's not let him, you know, get under our skin
I'm not, I haven't
I just, you seem a little more quiet than usual
I just -- I just wanna find the kids
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll give it my best shot
You won yourself a bear
Thank you. Here you go
Mayor Kline
One more, one more
Big smile. There we go

Happy Fourth, dick
Come on, come on, come on
Pick up, pick up, pick up, you commie bastards
Quiet
Oh, sorry
How do you even drink that
Because it's delicious
It's like Carpenter's The Thing
The original is a classic, no question about it
But the remake... Sweeter, bolder... better
You're insane
So, you prefer the original Thing
What? No, I'm not talking about The Thing, I'm talking about New Coke
It's the same concept, dude
Uh, actually, it's not the same concept
It is the same concept
No, it's not
Yes, it is

Did you... find him
The movies
Dustin's so freaked out about the gate, he decides to go watch a movie
Yeah, makes total sense
You're positive he said "gate"
and not "great"
Yeah, like, "This movie I'm watching is great."
Sounded like "gate."
Which would explain how the Mind Flayer's still alive
Yeah, we just have to shut it again
Then the monster dies
But if not, we always have Lucas' fireworks
Keep mocking my plan, Max
Keep mocking it
I wanna hear you say it again, because you keep doubting me
You keep doubting me
Ridiculous

We're gonna prove 'em wrong, right
The ceiling stopped spinning for me
Is it still spinning for you
You think we puked it all up
Maybe. Ask me something
Interrogate me
Okay. Interrogate you. Sure
Um... When was the last time you, uh, peed your pants
Today
When the Russian doctor took out the bone saw
It was just a little bit, though
Yeah, it's definitely still in her system
Oh... All right, my turn
Hit me
Have you... ever been in love
Yep. Nancy Wheeler
First semester, senior year
She's such a priss

Turns out, not really
Are you still in love with Nancy

I think it's because I found someone who's a little bit better for me
It's crazy
Ever since Dustin got home, he's been saying, "You know, you gotta find your Suzie
You gotta find your Suzie."
Wait, who's Suzie
It's some girl from camp, I guess his girlfriend
To be honest with you, I'm not 100% sure she's even real
But that's not that's not really the point
That doesn't matter. The point is, this girl, you know, the one that I like, it's somebody that I... didn't even talk to in school
And I don't even know why
Maybe 'cause Tommy H
would've made fun of me or... I wouldn't be... prom king
It's stupid. I mean, Dustin's right, it's all just a bunch of bullshit anyways
Because, when I think about it, I should've been hanging out with this girl the whole time
First of all, she's hilarious
She's so funny
I feel like, this summer, I have laughed harder than I have laughed... in a really long time
And she's smart
Way smarter than me
You know, she can crack, like, top secret Russian codes and... You know? She's honestly unlike anyone I've ever even met before

Robin, did you just OD in there
I... am still alive
The floor's disgusting
Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood and puke on my shirt, so... What do you think
About
This girl
She sounds awesome
She is awesome. And what about the guy
I think he's on drugs, and he's not thinking straight
Really? 'Cause I think he's thinking a lot more clearly than usual
He's not
Look... he doesn't even know this girl
And if he did know her, like -- like really know her, I don't think he'd even want to be her friend
No, that's not true. No way is that true
Listen to me, Steve
It's shocked me to my core, but I like you
I really like you
But I'm not like your other friends
And I'm not like Nancy Wheeler
Robin, that's exactly why I like you
Do you remember what I said about Click's class
About me being jealous and, like, obsessed
It isn't because I had a crush on you
It's because... she wouldn't stop staring at you
Mrs. Click
Tammy Thompson
I wanted her to look at me
But... she couldn't pull her eyes away from you and your stupid hair
And I didn't understand, because you would get bagel crumbs all over the floor
And you asked dumb questions
And you were a douchebag
And -- And you didn't even like her and... I would go home... and just scream into my pillow
But Tammy Thompson's a girl

Steve... did you OD over there
No, I just, uh... just thinking
I mean, yeah
Tammy Thompson, you know, she's cute and all, but... I mean, she's a total dud
She is not
Yes, she is
She wants to be, like, a singer
She wants to move to, like, Nashville and shit
She has dreams
She can't even hold a tune
She's practically tone-deaf
Have you heard her

You see me now tonight Shut up
You see me... She does not sound like that
She sounds exactly That's a great impersonation of her
She does not
You sound like a Muppet
She sounds like a Muppet
She sounds like a Muppet giving birth
And if you could hold me tight We'll be holding on forever Exactly


And why all this
If I just turn the keys, it's like turning off a car
But then the car still works, does it not

And do you want the car to still work or do you want it to explode
I want the car to explode
Good. Then do this
Just make sure you are nowhere near it when it does. It is not pretty
Turns people into dust
And then... It's over
And I become an American citizen and join in the fun, yes
Who said you had to be an American to join the fun
It doesn't get more American than this, my friend
Fatty foods, ugly decadence, rigged games... Fifteen tickets, please
They are rigged, these games
They do not look rigged
That's just it, my dear Alexei
They have been designed to present the illusion of fairness
But it's all a scam, a trick, to put your money in the rich man's pocket
That, my dear friend, is... America
But, hey... knock yourself out
To get us the closest thing to food I can find

Karen
Step right up
...feel the wind push you back and it's gonna Hold on. Do we have seat belts
Hey, Karen

Oh, my gosh! How funny to see you here
Where are the kids
I... I haven't seen them
I don't think they're here yet
You three, up against the wall
No, where are they
Oh, my gosh, I can hardly keep track these days
Uh, they were at, uh... Dustin's, then Lucas's, then Max's
Max... You know how it is. Summer
Probably getting into some kinda trouble
Last warning, you two
Up against the wall
Hold the ride
On your life, Magnum
Woo! Here we go
Holy smokes
Roads
Where we're going, we don't need roads
And... blend
It is so good
Well, shit, that worked
Course it worked
We just have to get on the bus with the rest of these plebes, and home sweet home, here we come
Uh, Dustin
Yeah, we might not wanna go to your house

Well, I might've told them your full name
What is wrong with you
Dude, I was drugged

So, you resist. You tough it out
You tough it out like a man
Oh, yeah, it's easy for you to say

Sorry for the inconvenience
Have a pleasant evening
Abort
Abort. Abort
Come on, let's go, let's go
That's three green
And here's dart number four
One more for the big prize
You can do it, mister
We have a winner
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen
Get your tickets right here
Murray

Keep pressure on it
I'll get you help
I'll get help
Jim... Jim

Jim! Alexei! They got Alexei, Jim
We gotta go
They make an odd couple, don't they
Well, it's like they say, there's someone for everyone
Who wants a hot dog
Find Murray, get the car, bring it around back
Heading to "Big Top."
Northeast side of the fair
Get your tickets to the Big Top here
...this side of the Mississippi
Hey! Get your kids outta here! Police
Get 'em out of here! Go
You, sir
Step on up
I see you eyeing the maze
Don't be surprised! Don't be scared
Step on up, sir
Do you dare enter the cave of horrors
You never know what you might find around the corner
Don't show your fear in the presence of the tiger
Or you may never escape this cave alive
I... I just left for a minute... for a corn dog
A stupid corn dog


Vasilev, are you there? Vasilev? Answer


Yeah, lady
Comrade
Get off me
Goddamn

Hit it. Hit it! Go! Go
On the lower level Hey, translate
We've found the children
They are still in the mall. Lower level
Keep all entrances locked down
I repeat Keep all entrances locked down
Everyone, get over here
I found them
You flung that thing like a Hot Wheel

Ask them. It's their fault
True, yeah. Totally true
It's absolutely our fault
I don't understand what happened to that car
El has superpowers

Superpowers. She threw it with her mind
C'mon, catch up
That's El
Who's El
I'm sorry, who are you
I'm Robin. I work with Steve
She cracked the top secret code
Yeah, which is how we found out about the Russians
Russians? Wait, what Russians
The Russians
Those were Russians
Some of them

Didn't you hear our code red
Couldn't understand what you were saying
Goddamn low battery
How many times do I have to tell you with the low battery
Well, everything worked out, didn't it
Worked out? We almost died
Yeah, but we didn't, did we
It was pretty damn close
Okay, Russians
As in, they're working for the Russian government
What are you not comprehending
Am I not speaking English
We have a full-blown Red Dawn situation
So this has nothing to do with the gate
It has everything to do with the gate... Whoa, whoa, whoa
El! El
What's wrong with her
What's wrong
My leg. My leg
Her leg, her leg. Okay
Get that off
El! El, are you okay
