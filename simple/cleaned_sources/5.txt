The gate
I don't understand
You've seen this before
Not exactly
Then what, exactly
All you need to know is it's bad
It's really bad
Like, end-of-the-human-race-as-we-know-it kind of bad
And you know about this how
Um, Steve? Where's your Russian friend
Shit
Halt! Halt
Go, go, go, go, go
Move! Let's move
Go! Shit! Shit, shit, shit
Go, go, go
Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit
Holy shit! Holy shit! Shit
Holy shit! Holy shit
Holy shit
Guards! Go
This way
Oh, shit! Oh, shit
Whoa
Come on! Go, go, go, go, go
Come on
Come on, quick
Hold the door
Robin
Help me, come on
Here! Come on, let's go
Go! Just get out of here
Go, come on, now
No! Just go get some help, okay
What are you doing
Go
I won't forget you
He's here
Nancy
Run
Damn
Hey
Hey, hey, hey! Two at a time
Oh, my God
Jonathan... No! Nancy
Jonathan
No, no! Nancy
Stairs
Goddamn it
Jesus
What the f Go
Are you okay? Are you okay
It's time
Stand up and meet your brother, honey One color or another But he's still He's still your brother Reach out and take his hand I want y'all to Help him understand... Hey! Excuse me
Excuse me. Excuse me
What -- what are you doing
What's -- what's this doing here
What
Your stand
It's right in the main thoroughfare
Where do you want it, sir
Over there with the rest of the goddamn food stalls
It isn't rocket science
Sheesh, do I have to do everything myself
My friends in state PD, highway patrol, they're all on the lookout
I got eyes everywhere
The second he pops up... I get a call
A call
Yes. A call
I mean, what more do you people want me to do
We want you to find him
Let me explain something to you
This man is a moron, okay
He's driving around in a yellow convertible, for Christ's sakes
He sticks out like a sore thumb
I will find him
And, when I do, may I suggest you bring some backup with you this time
Backup
Some comrades
Since last time, he got the better of you
Please... I -- I didn't mean that
You -- You don't need backup
This man is your fault, your problem
You're lucky you still breathe
Very lucky
Please
I'm sorry
I -- I have a bad temper
I'm going to therapy
You have one day to find this man for me
Nod if you understand
Two Whoppers, extra ketchup, large fry, pack of Marlboro Reds, and one extra-large... Slurpee
Burger King is nowhere near the 7-Eleven, by the way
Never said it was
Let's try this again. Joyce
Alexei, the generators, what are they powering
And tell him that we know it is not the Starcourt Mall, so he can stop selling us that crap
Those generators you were working on, what are you powering
We know it's not the mall
This tastes like shit strawberry
What'd he say
He says, "It's strawberry."
His... Slurpee
He says it's strawberry
So what
Hop, he did ask for cherry. I mean... Well, they didn't have cherry
They didn't have it
And it doesn't matter, because it all tastes the same, okay
It is sugar on ice. You tell him that
Tell him what
You tell him that it all tastes the goddamn same
It's all the same
Sugar on ice. No difference
Tell that stupid man it is not the same in the slightest, and I would like the cherry I requested
He respectfully disagrees
It's not the same at all, and he would like... cherry
Oh, yeah? You tell him... he can forget it
He says forget it. No cherry
No cherry, no deal
He says, "No cherry... no deal."
Yeah
Hm
Mm
Oh, shit
No, Hop Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I'm not gonna hurt him
Come on! Come on
I'm just giving him an opportunity to get his own damn... cherry Slurpee
Jim, that man is an enemy of the state
Yeah, who's been jerking us around for a full day
I get him his cherry Slurpee, then what
He wants a helicopter to charter him to his own private island
I have dealt with assholes like this my entire life
Yesterday in the woods, he could've escaped, but he didn't
He stuck with us
Why do you think that is
It's because... he's scared
He's scared
Not of us, of them
He's scared of that seven-foot-tall Russian freak who could've killed him just as easily as us
Smirnoff knows that if he runs back to his comrades without a scratch on him, they're gonna think that he spilled his guts
So, whether he likes it or not, we... are the best chance he's got
Ooh
I give him 30 seconds before he comes knocking on that door, right back into our arms, with a new sense of humility
I don't wanna take it anymore Jim... Uh... I, uh, believe he has started the car
Hopper
You know, testing us
He's just calling my bluff
'Cause I work so hard To make it every day Woo-ooh I believe he is now driving away
Jim. Jim, move
Joyce, Joyce Move, move, move
Yeah Ooh-ooh, huh Yeah And it's hard to say Just how some things never change And it's hard to find Any strength to draw the line Ooh, I'm just burning Doin' the neutron dance I'm just burning Doin' the neutron dance I know there's a pot of gold for me All I've got to do is just believe... Doin' the neutron dance And I'm just burning... I'm sorry, what did he say
He says he likes strawberry, too
I'm just burning In my feet Doin' the neutron dance, woo-hoo So, when we set fire to the hub, we drew the Demodogs away so El could close the gate
But now, for some insane reason, the Russians appear to be trying to reopen it, which just destroys everything we risked our lives for
By "we," you're including Lucas
Yes, of course
So, all that shit you told me, Lucas was there
My brother, Lucas Charles Sinclair
Yes
I don't believe you
Wait, so you believe everything about El and the gate and the Demodogs and the Mind Flayer, but you question your brother's involvement
That's correct
Makes total sense
Um, you need help with that
No
Well, I mean, it's taking a while, so Yeah, no shit, Sherlock
All right, so if we don't find a more efficient method to stop these fans, we're never gonna find help, and your ice cream buddies are screwed
Yeah, with that attitude, they are
Jee-zus
I'm just being realistic
I mean, we've made it about point-three miles in nine hours
Then we had to walk three hours down that tunnel, so I'd estimate ten miles back to the elevator, which should take us approximately twelve-and-a-half days
Did you just do all of that in your head
I'm good with numbers
Holy shit. You're a nerd
Come again
You... are... a... nerd
Okay, you better take that back, nerd
Can't put the truth back in the box
But it's not the truth
Let's examine the facts, shall we
Fact one: you're a math whiz, apparently
That was a pretty straightforward equation
Fact number two:
you're a political junkie
Just because I don't agree with Communism as an ideology Fact number three:
you love My Little Pony
And what does My Little Pony have to do with this
Ah, let's recall the ponies'
latest adventure, shall we
The evil centaur team and Tirek turns Applejack into a dragon at Midnight Castle, and then Megan and the other ponies have to use Moochick's magic to defeat his rainbow of darkness, saving them from a lifetime of enslavement
All the pink in the world can't disguise the irrefutable fact that centaurs and castles and dragons and magic are all standard nerd tropes
Ergo, My Little Pony is nerdy
Ergo, you, Erica, are a nerd
And how do you know so much about My Little Pony
Because I'm... a nerd
Let's go... nerd
You... That one stung
Who do you work for
For the millionth time, I work at Scoops Ahoy
Scoops Ahoy
What the hell
Look at my outfit
You think I just wear this
Think I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform
How did you get in
I already told you
I told you before
My delivery didn't come, and my friends and I, we thought that it was left at the loading dock, so we went in the room, and then it turned into an elevator, and then... and then we dropped and then, next thing we know, I open my eyes, and we're in this... wonderful facility
But I swear to God, nobody knows about us, nobody saw us
You could just let us go, all right
And I'm not gonna tell anybody about this, okay
Shit happens, life goes on
And, uh... ice -- ice cream
Ice cream, okay
You guys know what ice cream is
Everybody loves ice cream
I don't know if you have Russian ice cream or if that's considered gelato
I don't know what's what, but whatever you guys want, seriously
USS Butterscotch, I mean, you gotta try it
It is out of this world, I'm telling ya
I like this guy
"USS... Butterscotch."
Oh, come on. No, no! No, seriously Get your hands off me
Hey... Steve
Steve? Steve
Steve
What did you do to him? What did you do
Put them in the chairs
Don't touch me
Steve -- Steve, wake up. Steve
What did you do
Don't touch him
Steve? Steve, can you hear me
I think your friend need a doctor
Good thing... we have the very best
You are going to regret that, little bitch
Bastards
Let us outta here
Bastards! Let us out! Let us out
It can't be good for her to be in there for this long
Mike, you need to relax
What if she gets brain damage or something
Oh, shit. Is that, like, a real thing
No, it's not. He made it up
Mike doesn't know what he's talking about
Oh, and you do
No, I... Yes, from The Hawkins Post
I -- I called a couple days ago about the Yes, yes, um... I was just... following up to see if anything else had gone missing, or if -- Okay
Um, sorry to bother 
Who's next
There is no next
Unless you want to start calling random people's homes
It doesn't make sense
What part of any of this makes sense
There's a pattern, okay
A consistency to their behavior
They've been feeding on these chemicals since this started, and -- and, what, they just stop, out of the blue
Maybe they have all the chemicals they need
Maybe they've all turned into those... things
But what about the source
I mean, did the Mind Flayer just suddenly stop infecting people
And even if the flayed are monsters now, why can't El find them
Okay, can you guys settle an argument for us
Who do you think should decide El's limits
Mike or Eleven
The way that you frame that is such bullshit
It's not bullshit, Mike
This is your whole problem
And it's also precisely the reason why she dumped your ass
El dumped you
Yeah, because she is conspiring against me
She's corrupting her
No, enlightening her
The fact is, she's not yours
She's her own person, fully capable of making her own decisions
She's risking her life for no reason
For no reason
Mike, the flayed are out there doing God knows what
Killing, flaying... Transforming into monsters
And El's not stupid
She knows her abilities better than any of us
Exactly, thank you
And she is her own person
Exactly
With her own free will
El has saved the world twice, and Mike still doesn't trust her
You wanna talk about trust, really
After you made Eleven spy on us
Wait, what
Oh, she didn't tell you this
Your girlfriend used El's powers to spy on us
No, no, no, I did not make her
It was her idea
And why are we even talking about this, seriously
Yeah, who cares
I care
I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy
We were just joking around
Wouldn't it've been so funny if I was taking a massive shit or something
You weren't
But what if I was
Then gross
Seriously, Mike
I'm just trying to demonstrate how careless Max is with Eleven's powers
In fact, how careless all of you are
You're treating her like some kind of machine when she's not a machine, and I don't want her to die looking for the flayed when they've obviously vanished off the face of the Earth
So can we please just come up with a new plan because I love her and I can't lose her again
What's going on
Nothing. Nothing
Just a family discussion
Oh
I found him
Found who
He calls it the key, and this key emits a great energy
It requires much strength, power
Those houses, like the one you found, they're located near, uh, transformers
They're stealing from your town's power grid
Why build this key here? Why are they not doing this in their own backyard
What are they trying to do, blow us to smithereens
There were many of these, uh, keys before in Russia, but they turned out wrong
They had to come to where the... where the, uh... Where the what
I don't understand what he's saying
I thought you were fluent
Oh, I'm sorry
Are my free translation services not good enough for you
Because you can just go ahead and file your complaint right up my ass
What is Smirnoff doing
He's showing me
Oh, okay
Uh, he says the straw, they're using it to penetrate a hole in... a box
Okay, sorry, sorry
The straw represents the key, which emits a great energy
They're using this energy... to break through a barrier, to open... a doorway
A doorway between worlds
But it seems this key was only half the equation
Location -- Location was the other half
Oh, what In Hawkins, this door had been opened once
It was still... healing
Jesus Christ
So, this door is open now
He says it is... opening
Where are you going
To call our children
Can we watch Looney Tunes now
Nyet
Can I help you with something
Whiskey
You have whiskey
No, but I do have vodka
If there's a way to start this key, there's gotta be a way to stop it, yeah
Turn it off
Right
The key, is there a way to turn it off
He says, "Of course he could turn it off. Could... Edison not turn off a lamp, could Bell not hang up a phone?"
Cocky bastard. "But..."
But what
But he is now... "naked."
Sorry, "exposed." Compromised
Hey, I will get you there
I will get you to your key
You wanna ask him what the hell's so funny about that
He says he likes your courage
You remind him of a... ...fat Rambo
But he says that even thin Rambo couldn't get there
This key, it is in an underground fortress designed by the greatest Russian minds, guarded by their greatest warriors
Breaking in is... impossible
Jackpot
Oh-ho-ho
Do you even know how to drive
How hard can it be? Max did it
Aw, come on
You seriously thought they'd just leave keys in there
There's gotta be a spare
Hey, Dustin
How big did you say that Demogorgon was
Big. Nine feet or so. Why
Found 'em
Erica
What the hell is that
A deadly weapon
Could be useful
For what
What do you think
Taking down Commies, saving your friends
Thought you were more realistic than that, nerd
We don't even know where they are, and even if we did, there are a million guards up there with weapons way deadlier than that
The best thing we can do for them is to get out of here and find help
Easy with that
Our chance of surviving, and theirs, rises substantially
Just trust me on this. Please
Help
Hey, would you stop yelling
Steve! Oh, my God
Steve... Are -- Are you okay
My ears are ringing, and I can't really breathe, my eye feels like it's about to pop out of my skull, but, you know, apart from that, I'm doing pretty good
Well, the good news is that they're calling you a doctor
Is this his place of work
I love the vibe
Charming
Yeah, tell me about it. So, okay, do you see that table over there to your right? No, your other right
Yeah, okay
And do you see those scissors
Uh-huh
Yeah, well, I think that if we move at the same time, we could get over there, and then maybe I could kick the table and knock them into your lap
And I could cut the binds
Yeah, and we could get out of here
Gotcha. Okay, yeah, we can do that
Those morons. They left scissors in here
Yeah, morons
Total morons
Okay
Okay, so, on the count of three, we're gonna hop
Okay, good, hop on three. I gotcha
All right
One, two, three
Okay, that worked
All right. Uh, let's try again
Holy shit, this is gonna work
We're close. Ready
Okay, one, two, three
It's okay, it's okay
Don't cry. Robin
Are you laughing
I'm so sorry. It's just... I can't believe... I'm gonna die in a secret Russian base with Steve "The Hair" Harrington
It's just too trippy, man
We're not gonna die
We're gonna get out of here, okay
Just -- You gotta let me just think for a second
Do you remember, um, Mrs. Click's sophomore history class
Mrs. Clickity-Clackity
That's what us band dweebs called her
It was first period, Tuesdays and Thursdays, so you were always late
And you always had the same breakfast
Bacon, egg, and cheese on a sesame bagel
I sat behind you two days a week for a year
Mister Funny
Mister Cool
The King of Hawkins High himself
Do you even remember me from that class
Of course you don't
You were a real asshole, you know that
Yeah, I know
But it didn't even matter
It didn't matter that you were an ass
I was still... obsessed with you
Even though all of us losers pretend to be above it all, we still just wanna be popular... accepted, normal
If it makes you feel any better, having those things isn't all that great
Seriously
It just baffles me
Everything that people tell you is important, everything that people say you should care about, it's all just... ...bullshit
But I guess you gotta mess up to figure things out, right
I hope so
I feel like my whole life has been... one big error
Yep
At least it can't get any more messed up than this
You know, I wish I'd known you in Click's class
Really, I do
Maybe you could've helped me pass the class
Maybe instead of being here, I'd be on my way to college right now
And I would have no idea that there were evil Russians beneath our feet, and I would be happily slinging ice cream with some other schmuck
Gotta say, though, I liked being your schmuck
It was fun while it lasted
It was
Where were you two going
Try telling the truth this time, yes
It will make your visit with Dr. Zharkov less painful
Wait a second. Wait. Hold on
Okay! Wait, wait, wait
What is that thing
It will help you talk
Did you even clean that thing
What's he doing now
And that's not normal, right
Billy staying in his room on the Fourth of July
No, that's not normal
He wants us to find him
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of
If we go to Billy, then the rest of the flayed know where we are
It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed
We won't be surprised
We'll know that they're coming, and we will kick their flayed butts
You mean El will kick their butts
Papa
Rainbow
Three to the right, four to the left
Sunflower. Rainbow
It's too risky
Yeah, and unnecessary
Killing the flayed won't stop the Mind Flayer
We have to find out where it's spreading from
We have to find the source
Billy knows it
Billy's been there
To the source
Yeah, but It's a trap. I know
We can't go to Billy, but I think there's another way
A way for me to see where he's been
El, I know you think you have to do this, but you don't
It's just, you've only done this before once
And your mom, she loved you, and wanted you to know what happened
And Billy's mind is -- is sick, diseased
The Mind Flayer is in him
He can't hurt me
Not in there
We don't know that
Mike
I need you to trust me
Just... be careful
Billy
Can you hear me
I want to see
I want to see what happened
Something's wrong
Stop! No! No! No
El, are you okay
Are you okay
I'm okay
I'm... on a beach
Okay, I may be dense, but the last I checked, there weren't any beaches in Hawkins
What else do you see
A woman
She's... pretty
I... I think she's looking at me
Woo
You did it
There's... a boy
Did you see that
Yeah, I saw that
That was at least seven feet
I don't know what it was, but it almost gave me a heart attack
Ten more minutes
Yeah, okay, ten more minutes
But any longer than that, Dad's gonna be mad, okay
Watch out for rip currents
I know
It's Billy
It's California
It's a memory
I think I see it
The source
Two minutes, Jim
It's a secure line, but any longer than that and they could trace you
Yeah, I want 'em to trace me
Philadelphia Public Library
Uh... This is Jim Hopper... uh... police chief, Hawkins
I got this number from Dr. Sam Owens
What is your identification code
Identification code
You don't know it
You must be joking
Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it
I got it
You wrote it down and kept it in your wallet
"Antique Chariot." Listen
Um, tell Owens that the Russkies are opening the gate
Now, he'll know what that means
Not about the Russkies, but about the gate
Tell him that there's an entrance at Starcourt Mall
I know how to get in, but I need backup, a lot of backup
Have him call me back here at 618-625-8313
Your message will be relayed
So, now what
Now, we, uh... we wait
You compromised me, Jim
You do realize that, don't you
I'm gonna have to relocate
How long do we wait
As long as it takes
How can you just sit there being calm
I am not calm
Our kids are in danger
You said they were at the festival
Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate
What are you doing? Joyce
Yes, hello
Uh, this is, uh, Antique Chariot's partner... Wheelbarrow
I don't think Antique Chariot properly conveyed the urgency of our situation
Can't just sit around and wait for a call
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm
Don't you dare patronize me
I don't know who you are, if you're some glorified secretary or what, but if you don't wanna lose your job, here's what's gonna happen
When I hang up, you're gonna get up off your ass, and you're gonna go find Owens and tell him what's going on
We don't have time to talk about it and neither does he
He's gotta get to Hawkins, and he's gotta bring his men right now
Do you understand me
Yes, yes, ma'am
Thank you. And good day
It's been exactly one minute, Joyce
That's one minute too long
Alexei
We gotta go. Vroom, vroom
Back to Hawkins. Come on
Honestly, I don't really feel anything
Do you
I mean, I... I feel fine
I feel normal
Yeah, I feel -- I feel fine
I kinda feel good
Wanna know a secret
I like it, too
I feel good
Morons. They messed up the drug
They messed it up
Morons. Hey, morons
Morons
Moron! Mor Hey
Whoa-oh
Oh, no. There's definitely something wrong with us
Would now be a good time to tell you that I don't like doctors
Let's try this again, yes
Scoops
How did you find us
Totally by accident
More lies
What is that shiny little toy
Where you going with that, doc
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey
Wait! No! Wait! Wait
There was a code! We heard a code
Code
What code
"The week is long
The silver cat feeds when blue meets yellow in the west."
Blah, blah, blah
You broadcast that stupid spy shit all over town, and we picked it up on our Cerebro, and we cracked it in a day
A day
You think you're so smart, but a couple of kids who scoop ice cream for a living cracked your code in a day, and now, people know you're here
Who knows we are here, little bitch
Uh, well, Dustin knows
Hey, Steve
Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows
Dustin Henderson
It is your small, curly-haired friend
Oh, curly-haired. Great hair. Small
Kind of like a 'fro. Yeah
Where is he
He's long gone, you big asshole
And he's probably calling Hopper, and Hopper's calling the US cavalry
They're gonna come in here, commando-style, guns a-blazin', and kick your sorry asses back to Russia
You're gonna be two pieces of toast
Is that so
Hey! Henderson
That's crazy, I was just talking about you
Get ready to run
Hey! Billy, stop
What the hell is wrong with you
What did we talk about, huh
You gotta slide
Wait
Afraid you're gonna get hurt, is that it
Well, what then? What
What did I raise, a pussy for a son
Leave me alone
That's right, run
Like you always do
Where were you last night
Where were you
I told you, I was with Wendy
Stop lying to me
I'm not lying to you
You saw him again, didn't you
Didn't you
Get away from me
I said, get away
You -- You whore
Stop it
Bitch
Don't hurt her
You bastard
Mom
I don't understand. Why not
Please, Mom, don't do this
Please come home
No. How long? How long
I miss you
Get back here
Get up! What, are you scared to fight me
You scared
Get up and fight me, pussy! Pussy
Billy, come over here, I want you to meet someone
This is your new sister
Her name's Maxine
Max
Shake her hand
Who's there
I said, shake her hand
I said, who's there
I think I found it
Where, El? Where are you
Brimborn... Steelworks
Here. Okay, uh, steelworks, steelworks... Uh... Here, steel
Uh... Found it
6522 Cherry Oak Drive
That's close
El, El, we found it. Get out of there
Get out
He can't hear you
You shouldn't have looked for me
Because now I see you
Now we can all see you
You... let us in
And now... you are going to have to let us stay
David, where you going
David
Adam
You're gonna miss it
Don't you see
All this time, we've been building it
We've been building it... for you
All that work, all that pain... all of it... for you
And now it's time
Time to end it
And we are going to end you
And when you are gone, we are going to end your friends
And then we are going to end... everyone
Get away
El, you're okay. It's -- It's okay
El
