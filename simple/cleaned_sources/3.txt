I'm sorry, I did not quite catch your name
What happened
Help me
No
Which one
I don't know
Hey, there's nothing to worry about anymore, okay
It doesn't make sense
What doesn't make sense
Heather
The blood
The ice
Heather had a fever, so she took a cold bath, but she's better now
That has to be it
I don't know where that blood came from, but... we saw her
We both saw her. She's totally fine
What about Billy
What about him
He seemed wrong
Wrong is kind of like his default
But it's nice to know he's not a murderer, because that would've totally sucked
Who... is that
See, this is why you can't just hang out with Mike all the time
This is Wonder Woman
AKA Princess Diana
She's from Paradise Island, which is, like, this hidden island where there are only women Amazon warriors
Let me go! Let me go
Doris, we need you to stay calm for us, okay
Stay calm
I have to go back
Okay, so, you two want to explain to me what in the name of Jesus just happened here
Tom
Hi, Daddy
Heather... sweetie... whatever this is, whatever he's got you into, you don't have to do this
You can stop this
There is no stopping it, Daddy
You'll see
Heather, please! Heather
Try not to move
Jesus Christ
No Hey, careful
Careful
Here
Hey
Joyce
Oh
Here, here, here
It's okay
That's it. Got it
How long have I been out
A while
You've been drifting in and out
Yeah, but how did I get here
Slowly
What's the last thing you remember
Some thug attacked me
Hey, you need to rest
No, I'm fine
No, you're not fine, Hop I'm fine. I'm fine
Um... Where are my clothes
Uh... Uh... They were soaked
I mean, did you recognize him
Who
The thug
Well, I didn't get a good look
Well, I mean, he's gotta be government, right
Yeah, but if he's government, what's he doing slinking around
W-Why is he running
You know, why didn't we find anything down there
Let's ask him
What is that
His license plate
What are the dashes
Well, they're blanks
There was... I think it was either an H or a P with the part rubbed off
And there was definitely a Y
For sure
And that, I think, was a B, but it could've been an eight
And that -- Wait I think you should stick to sales
Can't you run a search or something
I just think you have to lower your expectations
I mean, this is a state government agency
Gonna take weeks before they find a match
Weeks
If we're lucky
And, I mean, what are the odds that this guy registers a car in his own name
It wasn't a car
Uh, what are you wearing
What do you mean it wasn't a car
Do you copy
This is a code red
I repeat, this is a code red
Max. Do you copy
Shut... up
She turned it off
You've got to be kidding me
I'm sleeping. Go away
This is Mike. Do not hang up
Something happened, something bad
Our very lives can be at stake
What are you talking about
Just come over to my house
We'll explain everything
What
Hurry
What did he say
Try Dustin again
He's not answering
So, try him again
Dustin, do you copy
That keycard opens the door, but unfortunately, the Russian with this keycard also has a massive gun
Whatever's in this room, whatever's in those boxes, they really don't want anybody finding it
But there's gotta be a way in
Well, you know... I could just take him out
Take who out
The Russian guard
What? I sneak up behind him, I knock him out, and I take his keycard
It's easy
Did you not hear the part about the massive gun
Yes, Dustin, I did
And that's why I would be sneaking
Ah
Well, please, tell me this, and be honest, have you ever actually... won a fight
Okay, that was one time Twice. Jonathan. Year prior
Listen, that doesn't count
Why wouldn't it? Because it looks like he beat the shit out of you
It was... You got a fat lip, crooked nose, swollen eye, a lot of blood... ...things that all added up... That just might work
Robin
Hey, Robin
Hey, what -- what are you doing
I need cash
Well, half of that's mine
Where're you going
To find a way into that room, a safe way
And, in the meantime, sling ice cream, behave, and don't get beat up
I'll be back in a jiff
Oh, dude
Come on, man, not my scooper
If he gets us the layout by noon, we can
Okay, I'll let him know
Dunno if they'll go through with it, but I just thought you should know
Nancy
Jonathan
I've worked at this paper for twenty-five years
Twenty-five... years
Now, we're a small-town paper, but we have something the big papers don't have:
trust
The trust of our community
Tom, if you just Do you know how I built that trust
By placing my faith in something the two of you don't seem to value a whole lot:
facts
Facts
So, while we're here, let's go over the facts
Fact one: you disobeyed a direct order to stop pursuing this story
Two: you falsely identified yourselves as reporters, repeatedly lying to an elderly woman
Three: you broke into her home, committing trespass
Four: she almost died en route to the hospital
She would've died if we hadn't shown up
Whatever disease that rat had clearly passed to her Five
Mrs. Driscoll is a paranoid schizophrenic
You didn't know that, did you
Now... disease-carrying rats
The second coming of the plague
Does this sound credible to you, or perhaps does this sound more like the delusions of a very sick old lady
I didn't know that
Her family's furious
So furious, in fact, they've threatened litigation
Litigation
That's crazy
For once, we agree
This is crazy
In fact, in my entire professional career, I've never dealt with anything quite like it
But hopefully, hopefully, you've learned something valuable here
You've learned... how in the workplace, in the real world, there are consequences to your actions
Which brings me to my sixth and final... fact
You're fired
Both of you
I didn't think it was anything at first
I mean, I think I just didn't want to believe it
The first time I felt it was at Day of the Dead
Power went out that night, too
And then I felt it again at the field near the Nelson farm the next day
Then again yesterday outside Castle Byers
Will
What does it feel like
It's almost like... You know when you drop on a roller coaster
Sure
Yeah
It's like... everything inside your body is just sinking all at once, but... this is worse
Your body... it goes cold and -- and you can't breathe
I've felt it before, whenever he was close
Whenever who was close
The Mind Flayer
Go away
I closed the gate
I know, but... what if he never left
What if we locked him out here with us
This is him
All of him
But, that day on the field, a part of him attached itself to me
My mom got it out of me... Get the hell out of my son
...and Eleven closed the gate
But the part that was still in me, what if it's still in our world
In Hawkins
I don't understand
The Demodogs died when El closed the gate
If the brain dies, the body dies
We can't take any chances
We need to assume the worst
The Mind Flayer's back
Yeah. And if he is, he'd want to attach himself to someone again
A new me
A new host
How can you tell if someone is a host
Hey, is he in
Yes, he's busy at the moment, but Great
Excuse me
You should sit down
...wouldn't listen Uh... Tony, hold on
Let me, uh... I might have to Let me call you back. Okay
Thanks
Jim
I know, I know
You're busy
I'm gonna make this fast, I promise
Is there... some kind of problem
Yeah. You might say that
Um, I'm looking for the name of a guy
The name of a guy
Yeah, I think you might know this guy
Okay
He was here the other day
Rides a motorcycle
Big build, square jaw, dark hair
He's probably military, maybe ex-military
Is this ringing... any bells
Uh... I don't think so
Really
'Cause it was just two days ago
This was right before I saw you
You know what
Could be the maintenance guy
Maintenance
Yeah. I can't remember his name
Oh, God... Uh... Gary or John or something
Candice will have his name on file
We've had trouble with the plumbing
Clogged toilets and... sinks with minds of their own
You meeting with a lot of plumbers, Larry
This guy, when I saw him, he was coming out of your office
Okay, well, I don't remember that
I shake a lot of hands, you know
Do you remember when I caught you passed out in the hideaway with all that powder all over your nose
You remember
Jim, come on, now
Do you remember when my boys found you and Candice going at it like a couple of bunnies in the back of your Cadillac
Do you remember that
Does your wife remember that
You, uh... You really wanna play this game
Huh
Not a game, Lar
Those pills you used to swallow like candy
I can't recall, did you have a prescription for those
Or how about drinking on duty
We have some real fun stories about that
One call to Tom at the Post... and you're done, buddy
You're gone
Oh, and, please, don't give me that dead daughter sob story, 'cause I just don't care
Now, if you don't mind, I really am rather busy
Operating directors Damn it
My nose! You broke my goddamn nose
And your friend almost killed me last night, so I'd say we're still not even
Larry
Let's cut the crap, Larry
Who is this guy? Government? Military
You're making a big mistake
Who is he
It's Arnold Schwarzenegger
Who you calling? The police
That is a nice ring you got there, Larry
Are you insane
Let's find out
Okay, okay, okay
Be cool, be cool
I don't know his name, I swear
Ah, ah, ah
But you know him
He... He gives me things sometimes
What kind of things
Money. Presents. Aah! Gifts
Who is this guy, Santa Claus
Starcourt. Starcourt
He works for Starcourt
The mall
Yes, yes
Yeah, right
Aah! I swear! I swear! I swear! Starcourt
They -- They own the mall
They want to expand to East Hawkins
They needed property, some land
Some people didn't want to sell, so I leaned on them a little. That's all
I swear, that's all
Why do they want this land
You have records of these purchases, these, uh... these land purchases
You don't want to mess with these people, Jim
I think you should worry about yourself right now, Larry, not about me
The records
Where are they
He just bumped his head
Just a little boo-boo, right, Lar
Have a nice day
It's bullshit
So, according to Tom, Driscoll's just a schizophrenic
And that rat is just a rat
And it's all, what, some big coincidence
You know what I think
I think Tom was on drugs
Did you see him
He was sweating like crazy
And his palms were clammy
He looked awful
Oh, is this funny to you
No, it's just kind of incredible
Incredible
Yeah, incredible how you just continue to convince yourself
What's that supposed to mean
I told you over and over to drop this story
That it was a bad idea
But you refused, and now, I'm screwed
It's a summer job
Your life is hardly over
I don't live in a two-story house on Maple Street
My dad doesn't earn six figures
Hell, he isn't even around
God, here comes the Oliver Twist routine
Mortgage, college tuition
You know, they're real things, Nancy
Things that you don't care about, only because you don't have to
I didn't realize I lived in a bubble
Well, you do
You want everything handed to you on a silver platter
I mean, we were interns, Nancy
Interns
What did you expect, that you would make star reporter in a month
Crack the big case
You sound just like them
You realize that, right
Just like Bruce and those assholes Yeah, yeah, those assholes gave us jobs
Is that what that was
That was humiliating
Humiliating
Yeah, the real world sucks
Deal with it like the rest of us
You don't know what it's like
Neither do you
Well, then, I guess we just don't understand each other anymore
Yeah, I guess not
Hey, you're home early
Yeah. Light day
It is fascinating what 20 bucks will get you at the County Recorder's Office
Starcourt Mall
The complete blueprints
Not bad
So, this is us, Scoops, and this is where we want to get
I mean, I don't really see a way in
There's not, if you're talking exclusively about doors
Air ducts
Exactly
Turns out, this secret room needs air just like any old room
And these air ducts lead all the way... here
Flashlight
Thank you
Yeah, I don't know, man. I don't know if you can fit in here. It's, like... super tight
I'll fit
Trust me. No collar bones, remember
Uh, excuse me
Oh, he's, uh... Yeah, he's got some disease
Chry, uh... It's chrydo, um... Something. Yeah, I dunno
He's missing bones and stuff
He can bend like Gumbo
You mean Gumby
I'm pretty sure it's Gumbo
Steve, just shut up and push me
I'll push ya
Not my feet, dumbass. Push my ass
Touch my butt! I don't care
Come on! Harder! Push harder
I'm pushing
You're playing with my legs
I'm not playing, I have terrible footing
Come on
I'm gonna just shove you, ready
Just shove me
One, two... Shit
That work
One more time
Ahoy, sailors! All hands on deck
Ahoy
Get over here and serve me some samples
He looks pretty normal to me
Normal? How many times have you seen him with a shirt on
I mean, it's a little weird
More than a little
He was in a tub with ice
The Mind Flayer likes it cold
Plus everything else But he's lounging at the pool, which is, like, the least Mind Flayer thing ever
Not necessarily
The Mind Flayer likes to hide
He only used me when he needed me
It's like... like you're dormant
And then, when he needs you, you're activated
Okay, so we just... wait until he gets activated
No. What if he hurts someone
Or kills someone
We can't take that chance
We need to find out if he's the host
Where are you going
I have an idea. Boys only
Seriously
Just trust me on this one
Okay, so we wait until the pool closes, until everyone leaves, and we somehow get him to come from here and... get him into here
Hey, shut the door
Hey, come on, kid, shut it
I think I just threw up in my mouth
And look, the controls are right here
It's perfect
Will it get hot enough
220 degrees
We just have to figure out how to get him in here
Then we lock him in... Heat him up... No matter what happens, we'll know
We'll know for sure
Hmm... Yeah, I don't know
You don't know if you can fit
Oh, I can fit
I just don't know if I want to
Are you claustrophobic
I don't have phobias
Okay, well, what's the problem
The problem is, I still haven't heard what's in this for Erica
More fudge, please
Go on
All right
You see this
This is the route you're gonna take
Then we just wait till the last delivery goes out tonight
Then you knock out the grate, jump down, open the door
Then you find out what's in those boxes
Mm-hmm
And you say this guard is armed
Yes, but he won't be there
And booby traps
Booby traps
Lasers, spikes in the wall
You know what this half-baked plan of yours sounds like to me
Child endangerment
We'll be in radio contact with you the whole time Ah, ah, ah
Erica? Hi. Uh... We think these Russians want to do harm to our country
Great harm. Don't you love your country
You can't spell "America" without "Erica."
Uh, yeah, yeah
Oddly, that's, uh, totally true
So, so, don't do this for us
Do it for your country
Do it for your fellow man
Do this for America... Erica
Ooh
I just got the chills
Oh, yeah, from this float, not your speech
Know what I love most about this country
Capitalism
Do you know what capitalism is
It means this is a free market system
Which means people get paid for their services, depending on how valuable their contributions are
And it seems to me, my ability to fit into that little vent is very, very valuable to you all
So, you want my help
This USS Butterscotch better be the first of many
And I'm talking free ice cream for life
Wow, I love the place, Lar
Hey, you shoot that fella yourself
That's -- That's not real
No shit
All right, so... what exactly are we looking at
Land deeds, transfers of property
So your buddies at Starcourt, they suddenly start buying up all this property
They tell you why
I already told you, they don't tell me anything
They're just using you, I get it
What I don't get is why you have a bunch of land deeds in a safe in your bedroom
These people, Jim, they're bad news
So, what, this is blackmail
Protection
Hold on a second
Hey, what is it
Hess Farm, Henry's place, Bullocks... Look, they're all here
They're all in Southeast Hawkins, right near Jordan Lake
And what else is near Jordan Lake
The power plant
Four nights ago, there was a huge power outage, and the next day Your magnets fell
Yeah, I mean, Scott says that this machine would take a massive amount of power to run
So, what if this machine that we've been talking about really does exist, and the reason that we didn't find it at the lab is because it isn't at the lab, it's at one of these properties
Um... I want you to... forget about sales
I want you to come work for me at the Hawkins PD
And have to look at your face every day
I don't think so
Hey, where do you think you're going, pal
Nance
Maybe Jonathan's right
To be honest, I wasn't thinking about him
I wasn't thinking about anyone, really
I just... I wanted to be right
I wanted to be right so badly
And were you
I thought so
But maybe I just... don't want to admit that I'm wrong, because if I'm wrong, then You're what everyone thinks you are
Just a kid who has no idea what she's doing
It's not easy out there, Nance
I know
People are always saying you can't
That you shouldn't
That you're not... smart enough, not good enough
This world, it... it beats you up again and again until eventually, I... Most people, they just... they just stop trying
But you're not like that
You're a fighter
You always have been
I honestly don't know where you get it from
Dad
I think you were swapped in the hospital, to tell you the truth
I get it from you, Mom
I get it from you
Well, wherever you get it from, I'm proud of you
Proud of me for getting fired
That you stood up for yourself
That you stood up to those... shitheads
Mom
Yes, those shitheads
And if you believe in this story... Look at me, Nancy
...finish it
Then go sell it to The Indianapolis Star or whatever and... I mean, can you imagine their faces when they read a story about their own town in a big paper like that
That would be... pretty amazing
So, why not
Why not
Finish it
Uh, Will
Um, you know, about yesterday... It's fine, Lucas
You don't have to say anything
I know, but it's just... It was a really cool campaign
And Mike and I, we should've never I don't care anymore, Lucas
I really don't
We have bigger things to worry about now
This should hold him
Hey, I found the breakers
Whoa, that thing is super creepy
Let me see it
I think this'll work. Right, buddy
Right, Mike
Hey, El... I just wanted to say... You know when I said Nana was sick
She wasn't. I lied
Right, right, right. No, I just... think it was important for you to know the context
Hopper, he went all crazy on me, telling me I'm spending way too much time with you
He made me lie. I mean, you're the most important thing to me in the world
What if he's right
Hop
No, no, no, no
He's just some angry old man who hates joy
But if I only see you, and I'm a different species than you, then I should be with my species more
Did you spy on me
That's totally against the rules
I make my own rules
Mike, are you there
Where are you guys
I'm coming. Just... hold on a second
Shit
God, I hope it's not you
I really hope it's not you
Erica, do you copy
Mm-hmm. I copy
You nerds in position or what
Yeah, we're in position
It's all quiet here, so you've got the green light
Green light, roger that
Commence Operation Child Endangerment
Can we maybe not call it that
See you on the other side
Nerds
Winnie
Winnie, is that you
Winnie, upstairs in the bedroom
Baby
Oh, my God, baby, what happened
Get me a phone
Baby Get me a goddamn phone
Anything
This place is dead
All right, where to next
Hess Farm
All right, nerds
I'm there
Do you -- Do you see anything
Yeah, I see those boring boxes you're so excited about
Any guards
Negative
If I could see them, they'd be pretty shit traps, wouldn't they
Thank you for that
I'm in
Oh, God
Free ice cream for life
Pool's closed
Do you hear me
Pool is closed
Billy

Just... Just step back, okay
Step back. Seriously
No! No
If you die, I die
What the hell
Was that just me, or did the room move
Let's just grab that and go

I didn't mean to
He made me do it
