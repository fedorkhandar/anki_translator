Shit! Shit
We're going down! We're going down
Yeah, no shit, Harrington
Why don't these buttons work
Press the button
What do you think I'm doing
Come on, press something
Just press the button
Push it
Oh
My groin
It fell on my groin
Dustin
Get this off of me
I can't move
Is everyone okay
Yeah, I'm great, now that I know that Russians can't design elevators
I think we've clearly established that those buttons don't work
They're buttons
They have to do something
Yeah, if we had a keycard
A what
It's an electronic lock
Same as the loading dock door
If we don't have a keycard, it won't operate, meaning We're stuck in here
Yeah
Just so you nerds are aware, I'm supposed to be spending the night at Tina's, and Tina always covers for me
But if I'm not home for Uncle Jack's party tomorrow and my mom finds out you three are responsible, she's gonna hunt you down, one by one, and slit your throat
I don't care about Tina
Or Uncle Jack's party
Your mom's not gonna be able to find us if we're dead in a Russian elevator
Hey
What if we climbed out
What were you saying about climbing
Looks like somebody's home
Did you hear that
Where's that coming from
It's below us
Hey, dipshits
Hawkins PD. Hands in the air
Don't make me say it again
English
You speak English
I can't understand you
No understand
Hopper
Don't move
Drop the gun
Drop it
You understand what I'm saying, big guy
Drop the weapon
Or what
You going to shoot
Good
So you do understand what I'm saying, huh
And, yeah, you don't put that thing away, I'm gonna blow some daylight into that thick skull of yours
No
You won't do that
Why's that
Because you are policeman
Policemen have rules
Oh, yeah
Wanna test that theory
I'm gonna count to three
One, two, three
Oh, shit
Go
Move, Joyce
Oh, God
Come on, Smirnoff
You're coming with us
Go, go, go
Let's go! Let's go
Move it, Smirnoff! Move it
Run
Joyce! Drive
Come on, Joyce! Quit screwin' around
Are you kidding me
Shit
Joyce, drive
I'm trying
Joyce, please, drive
Drive
Get us outta here
Hang on
Still think it was our government
God, shut up
Hello
Jonathan
Do you realize what time it is
Listen to me, okay
It's 6:00 a.m. and, uh, I had a late night with Fagin and the gang, so I'm at the hospital with Driscoll
What
She's been sedated for a few hours and the doctors are still running tests
Nancy, please tell me you're joking
It's not a joke
And, yes, I know I'm insane and irrational and out of touch, but can you save your lecture, because I really don't give a shit right now. I just... I need you to put me on the phone with your brother
Jonathan... Please
Uh... He's not even here
Where is he
Is he safe
Why wouldn't he be safe
Nancy
Son of a bitch
Okay, a magnet? Magnets
Do you know "magnet"? Magnet
Magnit
Yes, magnit
Okay, so, uh, magnit... on my -- my fridge, my icebox, and then they... they fell
They demagnetized, stopped working
Uh, do you understand
Da
Okay, so is that because of the machines that you're working on
Machina
Machina, machina, yes
Da, da, machina
Machina, machina
Yes, machina Vroom, vroom
Oh, not -- not the car
The machines at Hess Farm where where we kidnapped you Joyce, please
You're givin' me a headache, both of you
Hold on, please. One minute
I am making progress
Progress
What have you learned, huh
You learned that Smirnoff over there Alexei
Smirnoff is Russian and works for Starcourt, two things we already knew
Thought we knew
But now we know-know, because I've confirmed them
You're welcome
Yeah? Why don't you confirm whether this baby'll start, huh
Keep it in park, please
Yeah, duh
You do -- do something useful
You do something useful
It's not working
Try it again
Hey. Hey
Stop, stop
Shut up, Smirnoff
Aw, come on! D'you hear me
I said shut your damn Shit
Oh, Jesus
Whoa
Stop
I thought this friend of yours lived in Illinois
He's not really a friend
He's more like an acquaintance
Oh? Okay, well Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Keep up, keep up, keep up
Easy
Okay, so this acquaintance... lives in Illinois? Correct
Yeah, yeah
So we're walking to Illinois
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna walk to Illinois
You know, I figure we'll get there by, like, Friday evening
I hope that works for your schedule
Jesus Christ, Joyce
We're not walking to Illinois, okay
Well, then what are we doing
I don't know, okay
I will -- I will figure something out
Isn't there someone in Indiana who speaks Russian that You know what? I'm all ears, Joyce
I'm all ears
I mean, fine
Just saying
Gah
Ugh
Damn it
I found him
Woods
He's with... Will's mom
My -- My mom
What are they doing
Ill... annoy
They're going to Ill-annoy
Mike! Breakfast
Not now, Mom
Illinois? Illinois, like the state
The state of Illinois
Ill-annoy
Does it still hurt
Only when I talk
Well, it's a good thing you're not Mike, then
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
And you'd be in constant pain
Something's not right
I can't get Hopper off my back all summer, now all of a sudden, he's hiking with Will's mom to Illinois
And Dustin's MIA, too
I mean, this can't be a coincidence
What does it matter
The bottom line is, they're not here
It's up to us
Up to us to do what exactly
Find Billy and stop him
Okay, yeah, that's a really nice sentiment, but even if El could find him again, and that's a pretty big if, then what
We burn the shit out of him and make sure he doesn't escape this time
Okay, then what
Then we win
No, see, that's the problem
We don't. We don't win
We got the Mind Flayer out of Will before and he just came right back
We don't just have to stop Billy, we have to stop the Mind Flayer
How in the hell do we do that
I don't know
Maybe El does
What are they still doing in there
Girls just like hanging out in bathrooms
Why
I mean, I don't know
They're conspiring against me
That's what you're concerned about now
It's not my main concern
It's just a sub-concern
I thought it was already over
It's not over, okay
We're just taking a break
She said she dumped your ass
That doesn't sound like a break
It wasn't
You guys do realize we can still hear everything you're saying, right
Conspiring
I told you, they're conspiring
Mike, open the door
Code red, I repeat, code red
Does anyone copy
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red
We are innocent children and we are trapped under Starcourt Mall
The Red Army has infiltrated Hawkins, and if we are found, they will torture and kill us
Gotta take it easy on that thing
Gonna drain the battery
The mall just opened
So
So someone could be in range
What do you think, Petey the Mall Cop is gonna rappel down here and save the day
All right, why are you such a cranky pants after getting to spend the night with Robin
Shh! Jesus Christ
Will you just give up on your creepy dream already
I heard you guys talking all night
We were trying to figure out a way to open up the door while you children were sleeping
After eight hours, we're still exactly nowhere, which is, you know, probably just a little bit of the reason why I'm feeling just... a tad cranky
What are you doing
What does it look like I'm doing
I'm taking a leak. Look away
Look away
Can you redirect your stream, please
Hey, hey! Be careful, careful, careful
We don't even know what that is
Exactly. It could be useful
Useful how
We can survive down here a long time without food, but if the human body doesn't get water, it will die
I hate to break it to you, but this is not water
No, but it's a liquid, and if it comes down to me drinking that shit or dying of thirst, I drink
We've got company
You smell that
Piss
Let's go
Go. Go, go, go, go, go
I'm going
Henderson. Go, go
Come on, Steve, let's go
Jesus Christ
Ooh
You still wanna drink that
Holy mother of God
Well... hope you guys are in good shape
Looking at you, roast beef
Let's go, come on
Why me
It was the same thing, the exact same thing that happened to Will last year
And look at this
Look at the body temperatures
He likes it cold
Okay, so this crazy old woman who was eating fertilizer Mrs. Driscoll
Right, yeah, Mrs. Driscoll
What time was this attack
Last night
Right, but what time last night
Around 9:00
You waited all night to call
I was waiting for the doctors to run some tests
You weren't there
Well, I'm here now, aren't I
Hallelujah
Um, so, wha -- what time was your... sauna test
Well, that proves it
That proves my theory
She's flayed, just like Billy
Flayed
The Mind Flayer. He flays people
Takes over their mind
Once they do that, they basically become him
If there are two flayed We have to assume there are more
Heather
Billy was doing something to her
She was scared
She was screaming
Bad screams
What's a good scream
Max said Doesn't matter
I'm sorry, I'm lost. Who is Heather
She's a lifeguard at the pool
Heather Holloway
Tom
Seriously
Welcome to my world
Seat belts
Oh, my God. Can you not walk so close
Can you not walk so close to me
You stink
I get it, I get it. You're upset, right
'Cause I, uh... I blew up the car
Yeah, with me in it
Well, I just want to remind you of something, Joyce
I am not a mechanic
Yeah, clearly
That's why you should've listened to Alexei
Oh, right, yeah
Your new boyfriend, right
Yes. Every man I talk to from now on has to be my boyfriend
Yeah, he reminds me a bit of a Russian Scott Clarke
Oh, here we go
Maybe you should go on a date
I don't know, I'm thinking, like, Enzo's
He's running
You son of a bitch
Hey! Smirnoff
Get back here
Hey! C'mere
Hey, c'mere
You all gonna pay for those
So, what are you, some kinda bounty hunter
I'm a cop
I'm undercover
Oh, hey, Karen, it's Joyce
Yeah, I -- I'm just checking on Will
At the movies
Just keep your mouth shut, all right
All right, all right, hop in
Come on, get in
You "hey!" You "hey!"
This is a police emergency, all right
I need to commandeer your vehicle
As long as there's a... a... What is your name, sir
Todd
Todd... listen to me
That man in there, I know he doesn't look it, but he is one of the most dangerous men in the world
He's, uh... murdered many children
Yeah, he's a true psychopath
I tracked him over two state lines
Hey, what's going on
Ah, Detective Byers
Uh... this is Todd
He's agreed to... lend us his vehicle to transport our dangerous criminal
Oh, yes, he -- very dangerous, uh, forger... er
Yeah. Uh, child murderer
Child murderer
We should really get going
Hey, how do I get my car back
You just call the station
What station
Ooh, I like the sound of that, Todd
Hey, what station
You're doing the right thing
Hey, what the... Hey
Dude
I mean, you have to admit, as a feat of engineering alone, this is impressive
What are you talking about
It's a total fire hazard
There's no stairs, there's no exit, there's just an elevator that drops you halfway to hell
They're Commies
You don't pay people, they cut corners
To be fair to our Russian comrades, I don't think this tunnel was designed for walking
Think about it, they developed the perfect system for transporting that cargo
It all comes into the mall like any old delivery
And then they load it up onto those trucks and nobody's the wiser
You think they built this whole mall so they could transport that green poison
I very seriously doubt it's something as boring as poison
It's gotta be much more valuable, like promethium or something
What the hell is promethium
It's what Victor Stone's dad used to make Cyborg's bionic and cybernetic components
You're all so nerdy, it makes me physically ill
No, no, no
No, don't lump me in with them
I'm not a nerd, all right
Why so sensitive, Harrington
Afraid of losing cool points to a ten-year-old child
No, I'm just saying I don't know jack shit about Prometheus
Promethium
Prometheus is a Greek mythological figure, but whatever. All I'm saying is, it's probably being used to make something
Or power something
Like a nuclear weapon
Totally
Walking towards a nuclear weapon
That's great
That'd be great
But if they're building something, why here
I mean, Hawkins. Seriously. Of all places
At the very best, we're a toilet stop on your way to Disneyland, but maybe that's it
Maybe it's our very... You think the Russians know
About They could
So it's connected
Maybe
How
I don't know, but it's... Possible
I'm sorry, is there something you'd like to share with the class
Walkie
"A trip to China sounds nice
If you tread lightly."
It's the code
Wherever that broadcast is coming from It's close
And if there's one thing we know about that signal... It can reach the surface
Jesus, it's freezing
Do you guys smell that
More chemicals
You think they're guzzling this shit
Yeah, either that or they just went on a hell of a cleaning spree
But last year, Will didn't eat chemicals
Did you
This is something new
Mr. Clarke, fifth grade. Posit
What happens when you mix chemicals together
You create a new substance
What if they're making something
In themselves
I mean, come on, if you drink this crap, it'll kill you
Yeah, if you're human
Blood
Yesterday, Tom had a bandage on his forehead
He was attacked
Call 91 -- They must have tied them
They must have taken them somewhere
Mrs. Driscoll
She kept saying... "I have to go back."
What if the flaying, it's taking place somewhere else
There must be a place where all this started, right
A source
Somewhere he didn't want me to see
If we can find the source, then maybe we can stop him
Or at least stop it from spreading or doing whatever the hell he's doing with those chemicals
How do we find it
If she wants to go back so badly, why don't we let her
...this guy comes up to me, I'm just pumping gas over here, and he -- Hey, whoa
Don't cross me right now
Busy day
You could say that
Some psycho stole that dude's car
What else
What else did he say
This psycho
No offense, but I already went over all this with the cops
I'm not a cop
Yeah, no shit, Khrushchev
Don't look at them
At me
Tell me about this psycho
Come on, let's go
Move it
I thought you said this guy was a journalist
Yeah, he, uh... he was
Was
Look at the camera
The camera, above you to the right
Identify yourselves
Jim Hopper, Joyce Byers, Smirnoff
Alexei
Surname
Family name
Yeah, I know. I told -- I don't know, okay
Open the damn door
It's all right. Don't worry
He's a little bit eccentric, but... he's completely harmless
Name
Get that out of my face, you bald American pig
I may be bald, but you're the one in handcuffs, Soviet scum
Hi, Jim
Wait
Watch it
Silence, scum
How long is this gonna take, because I No
No, you do not get to question me
You have dragged an enemy of the state into my home as carelessly as a child drags in shit on his shoe
I will search him until I am satisfied
Jim. C'mere
Just c'mere
I need to talk to you
Yeah, what
This is not gonna work
What do you mean
He's not eccentric, he's certifiable
Glass houses, Joyce
You know, pot calling the kettle black
Oh, come on
Excuse me
Do me a favor and move your lovers' quarrel elsewhere
Oh, oh, this
Not a lovers' quarrel, pal
Spare me
What is your problem
Please, stop talking
No! We have had a very long day
We have been shot at, nearly blown up, walked God knows how many miles in a hundred degree heat, stole a car, all while being chased by this gigantic... psychopath, all so we could bring him to you
Because somehow, you're the closest person who speaks Russian, which I can't believe
But that doesn't matter because, unfortunately, we're here
So, if you don't mind, put that thing away, stop behaving like a jackass, and ask him what he's doing that's making my magnets fall off my damn fridge
Please
Okay, clear
Clear, come on, let's go
Okay, that was close
Too close
Relax
All right? Relax. Nobody saw... Shit
Jesus
Red Dawn
I saw it
First floor, northwest
Saw what
The comms room
You saw the comms room
Correct
Are you sure
Positive. The door was open for a second, and I saw a bunch of lights and machines and shit in there
That could be a hundred different things
I'll take those odds
All right
We're gonna move fast, we're gonna stay low
Okay
Shh
Sh, sh. Come on
Tread lightly
Who are you
Silver cat... Silver cat
I don't understand
China
You did it
You won a fight
Jeez... What are you doing
Getting us our ticket out of here
You want to walk all the way back
Well, we can hang out for a little bit, relax, have a picnic maybe
Have a picnic
We came here for the radio
This plan is way better
If I knew Steve could knock out a Russian, that would've been our plan in the first place
...but I guess you're Guys
There's something up there
Holy shit
No, that is not mean
That is honest
She won't find out
See, you're the only one who gon' tell Whoa, whoa, whoa! Excuse me
Where do you think you're going
Oh, um... I was just going to visit my grandma again
And -- And this... this is my family
Extended
I don't care who they are
You know the rules
Two visitors at a time
Yeah, but Two
Girl, this child has lost her mind
She brought a whole zoo in here
You know, those things that I said yesterday, I... I didn't mean them
I know
I don't think you're like those assholes
At all
I never have. I... I was just Angry
Which I still don't get
I mean, I was just completely, utterly, mortifyingly... wrong
Don't let that go to your head
I won't
I just look forward to you never doubting me again
Oh, come on, you piece of shit
Thanks
Dude, I think that was it
That was what
The olive branch
The what
Oh, my God
You're hopeless
Okay, I'll distract Max, get you an opening
And then talk to her. All right
Where is she
Are you sure this is the right room
She's gone home
We were hoping you might come back
Whose blood is that
Tom, whatever you've done, it's not you
He's making you do this
Owie
Got it, two in a row
That was good, that was good
Best three in a row now
Hi
Does your species like M&M's
I like the new look, by the way
It's cool
This way, this way
Hello? Hello
Here
It's ringing
I don't care how good her pie is
No, I don't want her in my damn house
Come on, pick up
Hi there
I'm here for you, Nancy Drew
You bitch
Help! Help
Help
Is anyone here
Where are you going
Yoo-hoo
Nancy Drew, where are you
Marco... Marco... Polo
