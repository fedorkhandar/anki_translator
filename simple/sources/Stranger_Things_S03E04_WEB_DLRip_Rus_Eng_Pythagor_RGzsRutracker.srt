I don't know.

10
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:47,089
Hey, there's nothing to worry about
anymore, okay?

11
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,051
It doesn't make sense.

13
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,430

The ice.

16
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:04,356
Heather had a fever, so she took
a cold bath, but she's better now.

17
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,358
That has to be it.

18
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,318
I don't know where that blood
came from, but...

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,987
we saw her.

20
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,948
We both saw her. She's totally fine.

21
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:15,993
What about Billy?

22
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,287
What about him?

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,915
He seemed wrong.

24

[chuckles] Wrong is kind of like
his default.

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,297
But it's nice to know he's not a murderer,
because that would've totally sucked.

See, this is why you can't just
hang out with Mike all the time.

29

31
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,482
She's from Paradise Island,

you don't have to do this.

You can stop this.

60

Yeah, but how did I get here?

120

-Who?
-The thug.

121
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,155
[Hopper] Well, I didn't get a good look.

122
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,158
Well, I mean,
he's gotta be government, right?

123
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,912
Yeah, but if he's government,
what's he doing slinking around?

124
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,622
W-Why is he running?

125
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,582
You know,
why didn't we find anything down there?

126
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,791
Let's ask him.

127
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,377
What is that?

128
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,879
His license plate.

129
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,798
-What are the dashes?
-Well, they're blanks.

130
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,426
There was...
I think it was either an H or a P

131
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,053
with the part rubbed off.

132
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,138
And there was definitely a Y.

133
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,389
For sure.

134
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,601
And that, I think, was a B,
but it could've been an eight.

135
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,727
And that-- Wait--

136
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,562
I think you should stick to sales.

137
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,899
Can't you run a search or something?

138
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,319
I just think you have to lower
your expectations.

139

before they find a match.

-Weeks?
-If we're lucky.

00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,954
what are the odds that this guy

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,234
Ah.

187
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,111
Well, please, tell me this,
and be honest,

188
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,572
have you ever actually... won a fight?

189
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,948
Okay, that was one time--

190
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,533
Twice. Jonathan. Year prior?

191
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,826
Listen, that doesn't count.

192
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,537
Why wouldn't it? Because it looks
like he beat the shit out of you.

193
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,414
-It was...
-You got a fat lip, crooked nose,

194
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,958
-swollen eye, a lot of blood...
-...things that all added up...

195
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,376
That just might work.

196
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:48,713
[Steve] Robin.

197
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,965
Hey, Robin!
Hey, what-- what are you doing?

198
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,675
-I need cash.
-Well, half of that's mine.

199
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,719
-Where're you going?
-To find a way into that room,

200
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:55,762
a safe way.

201
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,764
And, in the meantime,
sling ice cream,

202
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,141
behave, and don't get beat up.

203
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,518
I'll be back in a jiff.

204
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,938
Oh, dude.

205
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,440
Come on, man, not my scooper.

206
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,279
[phone ringing]

207
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,865
[drawer opens, closes]

208
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,660
[man] If he gets us
the layout by noon, we can.

209
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,036
[woman] Okay, I'll let him know.

210
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,704
[makes choking noise]

211
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,915
[laughs]

212
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,586
Dunno if they'll go through with it,
but I just thought you should know.

213
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,843
[suspenseful music playing]

214
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:36,719
Nancy.

215
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,223
Jonathan.

216
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,893
[Tom] <i>I've worked at this paper</i>
<i>for twenty-five years.</i>

217
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,728
Twenty-five...

218
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,564
years.

219
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:49,732
Now, we're a small-town paper,

220
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,693
but we have something
the big papers don't have:

221
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,069
trust.

222
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,197
-The trust of our community.
-Tom, if you just--

223
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,409
Do you know how I built that trust?
By placing my faith in something

224
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,619
the two of you don't seem to value
a whole lot:

225
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:03,830
facts.

226
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,291
Facts.

227
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,377
So, while we're here,
let's go over the facts.

228
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,798
Fact one: you disobeyed a direct order
to stop pursuing this story.

229
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,051
Two: you falsely identified yourselves
as reporters,

230
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,470
repeatedly lying to an elderly woman.

231
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:23,433
Three: you broke into her home,
committing trespass.

232
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,476
Four: she almost died en route
to the hospital.

233
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,478
She would've died if we hadn't shown up!

234
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,064
Whatever disease that rat had
clearly passed to her--

235
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,526
Five!
Mrs. Driscoll is a paranoid schizophrenic.

236
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,197
You didn't know that, did you?

237
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,157
Now...

238
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,492
disease-carrying rats?

239
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,579
The second coming of the plague?
Does this sound credible to you,

240
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,540
or perhaps does this sound more like
the delusions of a very sick old lady?

241
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,335
-I didn't know that.
-Her family's furious.

242
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,420
So furious, in fact,
they've threatened litigation.

243
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,672
-Litigation?
-That's crazy.

244
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,007
For once, we agree.

245
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,717
This is crazy.

246
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,427
In fact, in my entire professional career,

247
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,387
I've never dealt with anything
quite like it.

248
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,473
But hopefully,

249
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,726
hopefully, you've learned
something valuable here.

250
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,020
You've learned...

251
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,022
how in the workplace,

252
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,732
in the real world,

253
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,026
there are consequences to your actions.

254
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,237
Which brings me to my sixth and final...

255
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,280
fact.

256
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,241
You're fired.

257
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,494
Both of you.

258
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,169
[Will] <i>I didn't think it was anything</i>
<i>at first.</i>

259
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,381
I mean, I think I just didn't want
to believe it.

260
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,718
The first time I felt it
was at <i>Day of the Dead.</i>

261
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,887
[fluttering sound]

262
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,598
-Power went out that night, too.
-And then I felt it again

263
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,600
at the field near the Nelson farm
the next day.

264
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,685
[gasps]

265
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,729
Then again yesterday outside Castle Byers.

266
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:52,897
[fluttering sound]

267
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,107
[Lucas] Will!

268
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,566
What does it feel like?

269
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,402
It's almost like...

270
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,280
You know when you drop
on a roller coaster?

271
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,406
-Sure.
-Yeah.

272
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,491
-No.
-It's like...

273
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,827
everything inside your body

274
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,413
is just sinking all at once, but...

275
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,415
this is worse.

276
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,457
Your body...

277
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,669
it goes cold and-- and you can't breathe.

278
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,755
I've felt it before,

279
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,882
whenever he was close.

280
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,801
-[thunderclap]
-[snarling]

281
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,928
Whenever who was close?

282
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,513
The Mind Flayer.

283
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,141
Go away!

284
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,476
Go away!

285
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,812
I closed the gate.

286
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,147
I know, but...

287
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,858
what if he never left?

288
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,612
What if we locked him out here with us?

289
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,784
This is him.

290
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:47,702
All of him.

291
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,495
But, that day on the field,

292
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,165
a part of him attached itself to me.

293
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,374
[hyperventilating]

294
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,961
My mom got it out of me...

295
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,589
Get the hell out of my son!

296
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,258
...and Eleven closed the gate.

297
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,012
[screaming]

298
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,640
But the part that was still in me,
what if it's still in our world?

299
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,772
In Hawkins.

300
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,192
I don't understand.
The Demodogs died when El closed the gate.

301
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,069
[Max] If the brain dies, the body dies.

302
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,487
We can't take any chances.

303
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,821
We need to assume the worst.

304
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,448
The Mind Flayer's back.

305
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,242
[Will] Yeah. And if he is,

306
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,453
he'd want to attach himself
to someone again.

307
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,579
A new me.

308
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,705
A new host.

309
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,376
How can you tell if someone is a host?

310
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,847
[Hopper grumbles]

311
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:53,935
Hey, is he in?

312
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,812
-Yes, he's busy at the moment, but--
-Great.

313
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,188
Excuse me.

314
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,564
You should sit down.

315
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,233
...wouldn't listen--

316
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,276
Uh...

317
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,653
Tony, hold on.

318
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,905
Let me, uh...

319
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,658
I might have to--
Let me call you back. Okay.

320
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,951
Thanks.

321
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,286
-Jim.
-I know, I know.

322
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,455
You're busy.
I'm gonna make this fast, I promise.

323
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,165
Is there...

324
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,834
some kind of problem?

325
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,961
Yeah. You might say that.

326
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,255
Um, I'm looking for the name of a guy.

327
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,673
The name of a guy.

328
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,383
Yeah, I think you might know this guy.

329
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,176
-Okay.
-He was here the other day.

330
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,428
Rides a motorcycle.

331
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,683
Big build, square jaw, dark hair.

332
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,935
He's probably military, maybe ex-military?

333
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,272
Is this ringing... any bells?

334
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,023
Uh... [chuckles]

335
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,316
I don't think so.

336
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,484
Really?

337
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,486
'Cause it was just two days ago.

338
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,821
This was right before I saw you.

339
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,738
Oh!

340
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,198
-You know what?
-What?

341
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,616
Could be the maintenance guy.

342
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,702
-Maintenance.
-Yeah. I can't remember his name.

343
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,328
Oh, God... Uh...

344
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,330
Gary or John or something.

345
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,166
Candice will have his name on file.

346
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,044
We've had trouble with the plumbing.
Clogged toilets and...

347
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,298
sinks with minds of their own. [chuckles]

348
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,092
You meeting with a lot of plumbers, Larry?

349
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,136
Excuse me?

350
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,848
This guy, when I saw him,
he was coming out of your office.

351
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,393
Okay, well, I don't remember that.

352
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,896
I shake a lot of hands, you know?

353
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,361
Do you remember when I caught you
passed out in the hideaway

354
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,113
with all that powder all over your nose?

355
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,199
-You remember?
-Jim, come on, now.

356
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,952
Do you remember when my boys
found you and Candice going at it

357
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,246
like a couple of bunnies
in the back of your Cadillac?

358
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,540
Do you remember that?

359
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,543
Does your wife remember that?

360
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,920
You, uh... [clears throat]

361
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,254
You really wanna play this game?

362
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,172
Huh?

363
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,924
Not a game, Lar.

364
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,133
Okay.

365
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,594
Those pills you used to swallow
like candy.

366
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,388
I can't recall,
did you have a prescription for those?

367
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,474
Or how about drinking on duty?

368
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,351
[chuckling]

369
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,352
Yeah.

370
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,939
We have some real fun stories about that.

371
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,775
[chuckles]

372
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,444
One call to Tom at the <i>Post...</i>

373
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,655
and you're done, buddy.

374
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,615
You're gone.

375
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,617
Oh, and, please,

376
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:18,246
don't give me that dead daughter
sob story,

377
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,373
'cause I just don't care.

378
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,333
Now, if you don't mind,

379
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,168
I really am rather busy.

380
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,753
Operating directors--

381
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,047
[Larry grunts] Damn it!

382
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,382
[wailing]

383
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,968
My nose! You broke my goddamn nose!

384
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,803
And your friend almost killed me
last night,

385
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,596
so I'd say we're still not even.

386
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,722
Larry?

387
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,766
-[Hopper] Let's cut the crap, Larry!
-Larry!

388
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,477
-Who is this guy? Government? Military?
-You're making a big mistake.

389
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,520
Who is he?

390
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,146
It's Arnold Schwarzenegger.

391
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,190
-[Candice] Larry!
-[Larry groans]

392
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,610
Who you calling? The police?

393
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,076
That is a nice ring you got there, Larry.

394
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,578
Are you insane?

395
00:17:58,661 --> 00:17:59,620
I don't know.

396
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,997
Let's find out.

397
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,874
[grunts] Okay, okay, okay.
Be cool, be cool.

398
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,503
I don't know his name, I swear.

399
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,464
-[sighs]
-[screams] Ah, ah, ah!

400
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,882
But you know him.

401
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,094
He... He gives me things sometimes.

402
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,262
What kind of things?

403
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,889
Money. Presents. Aah! Gifts.

404
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,224
Who is this guy, Santa Claus?

405
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,351
Starcourt. Starcourt.
He works for Starcourt.

406
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,729
-The mall?
-Yes, yes.

407
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,980
Yeah, right.

408
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,983
Aah! I swear! I swear! I swear! Starcourt.

409
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,067
They-- They own the mall.

410
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,613
They want to expand to East Hawkins.
They needed property, some land.

411
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:37,366
Some people didn't want to sell,
so I leaned on them a little. That's all.

412
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,452
I swear, that's all.

413
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,079
[sighs, groans]

414
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,664
[groans]

415
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,959
-Why do they want this land?
-I don't know!

416
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,961
You have records of these purchases,
these, uh...

417
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,921
these land purchases?

418
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,216
[breathing rapidly]

419
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,469
You don't want to mess with these people,
Jim.

420
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,889
I think you should worry about yourself
right now, Larry, not about me.

421
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,350
The records.

422
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:03,976
Where are they?

423
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,020
-[Larry groans]
-Larry?

424
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,438
[Hopper] He just bumped his head.

425
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,774
-Just a little boo-boo, right, Lar?
-[grunts]

426
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,734
Have a nice day.

427
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,027
Larry!

428
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:15,905
[Nancy] It's bullshit.

429
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,408
So, according to Tom,
Driscoll's just a schizophrenic?

430
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,619
And that rat is just a rat?

431
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,829
And it's all, what, some big coincidence?

432
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,373
You know what I think?

433
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,083
I think Tom was on drugs.

434
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,584
-What?
-Did you see him?

435
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,336
He was sweating like crazy.

436
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,504
And his palms were clammy.

437
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,130
-He looked awful.
-[chuckles]

438
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,549
-Oh, is this funny to you?
-No.

439
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,385
No, it's just kind of incredible.

440
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,636
Incredible?

441
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,514
Yeah, incredible how you just continue
to convince yourself.

442
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,848
What's that supposed to mean?

443
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,851
I told you over and over
to drop this story.

444
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,978
-That it was a bad idea.
-[scoffs]

445
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,356
But you refused, and now, I'm screwed.

446
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,692
It's a summer job.
Your life is hardly over.

447
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,985
I don't live in a two-story house
on Maple Street.

448
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,570
My dad doesn't earn six figures.

449
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,072
Hell, he isn't even around.

450
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,740
God, here comes the Oliver Twist routine.

451
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,826
Mortgage, college tuition.

452
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,869
You know, they're real things, Nancy.

453
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,539
Things that you don't care about,
only because you don't have to.

454
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,208
-I didn't realize I lived in a bubble!
-Well, you do!

455
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,669
You want everything handed to you
on a silver platter.

456
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,130
I mean, we were interns, Nancy!

457
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,631
Interns!

458
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,385
What did you expect, that you would make
star reporter in a month?

459
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,803
Crack the big case?

460
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,347
You sound just like them.
You realize that, right?

461
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,932
Just like Bruce and those assholes--

462
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,101
Yeah, yeah, those assholes gave us jobs.

463
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,979
Is that what that was?
That was humiliating.

464
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,397
Humiliating.

465
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,023
Yeah, the real world sucks.

466
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,401
Deal with it like the rest of us.

467
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,572
You don't know what it's like.

468
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,616
Neither do you.

469
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,034
[scoffs]

470
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,581
Well, then, I guess we just don't
understand each other anymore.

471
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,125
Yeah, I guess not.

472
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,511
Hey, you're home early.

473
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,722
Yeah. Light day.

474
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,140
[Nancy sniffles]

475
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,484
[Robin] <i>It is fascinating</i>
<i>what 20 bucks will get you</i>

476
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,110
<i>at the County Recorder's Office.</i>

477
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,696
Starcourt Mall.

478
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,822
The complete blueprints.

479
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,115
Not bad.

480
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,825
So, this is us, Scoops,

481
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,744
and this is where we want to get.

482
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,287
I mean, I don't really see a way in.

483
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,288
There's not,

484
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:33,167
if you're talking exclusively about doors.

485
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,002
Air ducts.

486
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,128
Exactly.

487
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:40,007
Turns out, this secret room needs air
just like any old room.

488
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,718
And these air ducts

489
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,054
lead all the way...

490
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:49,725
here.

491
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,527
Flashlight.

492
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,654
Thank you.

493
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:08,118
Yeah, I don't know, man. I don't know
if you can fit in here. It's, like...

494
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,662
super tight.

495
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,621
I'll fit.

496
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,623
Trust me. No collar bones, remember?

497
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,791
Uh, excuse me?

498
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,962
Oh, he's, uh...
Yeah, he's got some disease.

499
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,047
Chry, uh... It's chrydo, um...

500
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,966
Something. Yeah, I dunno.

501
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,051
He's missing bones and stuff.
He can bend like Gumbo.

502
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,678
You mean Gumby.

503
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,304
I'm pretty sure it's Gumbo.

504
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,348
-Steve, just shut up and push me!
-Okay.

505
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,226
I'll push ya.

506
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,646
-Not my feet, dumbass. Push my ass.
-[Steve] What?

507
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,314
Touch my butt! I don't care!

508
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,692
-Come on! Harder! Push harder!
-I'm pushing!

509
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,404
-You're playing with my legs.
-I'm not playing, I have terrible footing.

510
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,406
-Come on!
-I'm gonna just shove you, ready?

511
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,283
-[Dustin] Just shove me?
-One, two...

512
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,118
-Shit.
-[Steve] That work?

513
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,871
-[Dustin] One more time.
-Ahoy, sailors! All hands on deck!

514
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:52,913
Ahoy!

515
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,415
-[bell dinging]
-[Erica] Come on.

516
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,750
Get over here
and serve me some samples.

517
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,630
I don't know.
He looks pretty normal to me.

518
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,426
Normal? How many times
have you seen him with a shirt on?

519
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,678
I mean, it's a little weird.

520
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,762
More than a little.

521
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,724
He was in a tub with ice.
The Mind Flayer likes it cold.

522
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:15,144
-Plus everything else--
-But he's lounging at the pool,

523
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,438
which is, like,
the least Mind Flayer thing ever.

524
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,023
Not necessarily.

525
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,568
The Mind Flayer likes to hide.

526
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,320
He only used me when he needed me.

527
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,489
It's like... like you're dormant.

528
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,492
And then, when he needs you,

529
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,745
you're activated.

530
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,955
Okay, so we just...

531
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,498
wait until he gets activated.

532
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,000
No. What if he hurts someone?

533
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,084
Or kills someone.

534
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,628
We can't take that chance.

535
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,713
We need to find out if he's the host.

536
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,467
-Where are you going?
-I have an idea. Boys only.

537
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,469
-Seriously?
-Just trust me on this one.

538
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,270
Okay, so we wait until the pool closes,
until everyone leaves,

539
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,357
and we somehow get him
to come from here and...

540
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:04,944
get him into here.

541
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,199
-Hey, shut the door!
-[man] Hey, come on, kid, shut it!

542
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,495
I think I just threw up in my mouth.

543
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,039
And look, the controls are right here.
It's perfect.

544
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,124
-Will it get hot enough?
-220 degrees.

545
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,543
We just have to figure out
how to get him in here.

546
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,212
-Then we lock him in...
-Heat him up...

547
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,589
No matter what happens, we'll know.

548
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:26,966
We'll know for sure.

549
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,390
Hmm...

550
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,978
-Yeah, I don't know.
-You don't know if you can fit?

551
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,772
Oh, I can fit.
I just don't know if I want to.

552
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,107
Are you claustrophobic?

553
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,150
[snickers] I don't have phobias.

554
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,612
-Okay, well, what's the problem?
-The problem is,

555
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,698
I still haven't heard what's in this

556
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,449
for Erica.

557
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,370
[nautical tune playing]

558
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,959
More fudge, please.<i> </i>

559
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,920
Go on.

560
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:11,301
[Robin] All right.

561
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,015
You see this?
This is the route you're gonna take.

562
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,809
Then we just wait till the last delivery
goes out tonight.

563
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,603
Then you knock out the grate,
jump down, open the door.

564
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,565
-Then you find out what's in those boxes?
-Exactly.

565
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,566
[Erica] Mm-hmm.

566
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,359
And you say this guard is armed.

567
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,028
Yes, but he won't be there.

568
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,071
-And booby traps?
-Booby traps?

569
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,490
-Lasers, spikes in the wall?
-What?

570
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,785
You know what this half-baked plan
of yours sounds like to me?

571
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,954
Child endangerment.

572
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,998
We'll be in radio contact with you
the whole time--

573
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,416
Ah, ah, ah!

574
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,918
Child endangerment.

575
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,880
Erica? Hi. Uh...

576
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,675
We think these Russians
want to do harm to our country.

577
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,386
Great harm. Don't you love your country?

578
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,097
You can't spell "America" without "Erica."

579
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,850
[slurping loudly]

580
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,602
Uh, yeah, yeah.

581
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,313
Oddly, that's, uh, totally true.

582
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,315
So, so, don't do this for us.

583
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,775
Do it for your country.

584
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,152
Do it for your fellow man.

585
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,781
-[slurping continues]
-Do this for America... Erica.

586
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,450
Ooh!

587
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,118
I just got the chills.

588
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,079
Oh, yeah, from this float,

589
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,371
not your speech.

590
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,416
Know what I love most about this country?

591
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,542
Capitalism.

592
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,544
-Do you know what capitalism is?
-Yeah.

593
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,964
-Yeah.
-It means this is a free market system.

594
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,217
Which means people get paid
for their services,

595
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,011
depending on how valuable
their contributions are.

596
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,513
And it seems to me,

597
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,557
my ability to fit into that little vent

598
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:43,227
is very, very valuable to you all.

599
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,604
So, you want my help?

600
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,439
This USS <i>Butterscotch</i>

601
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,566
better be the first of many.

602
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,860
And I'm talking free ice cream

603
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,321
for life.

604
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,622
[Hopper whistles]

605
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,415
Wow, I love the place, Lar.

606
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,876
Hey, you shoot that fella yourself?

607
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,420
[Larry winces] That's-- That's not real.

608
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,714
No shit!

609
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,188
All right, so...

610
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,774
what exactly are we looking at?

611
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,193
Land deeds, transfers of property.

612
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,695
So your buddies at Starcourt,

613
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,239
they suddenly start buying up
all this property.

614
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,117
-They tell you why?
-I already told you,

615
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,368
they don't tell me anything.

616
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,078
They're just using you, I get it.

617
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,371
What I don't get

618
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,875
is why you have a bunch of land deeds

619
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,460
in a safe in your bedroom.

620
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:51,879
These people, Jim,

621
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,548
they're bad news.

622
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,216
So, what, this is blackmail?

623
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,468
-Protection.
-Protection.

624
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,345
Hold on a second.

625
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,349
Hey, what is it?

626
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,727
Hess Farm, Henry's place,

627
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,936
Bullocks...

628
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,354
Look, they're all here.

629
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,608
They're all in Southeast Hawkins,
right near Jordan Lake.

630
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,526
And what else is near Jordan Lake?

631
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,153
The power plant.

632
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,239
Four nights ago,
there was a huge power outage,

633
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,366
-and the next day--
-Your magnets fell.

634
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,286
Yeah, I mean, Scott says that this machine

635
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,955
would take a massive amount of power
to run.

636
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,166
-Yeah.
-So, what if this machine

637
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,002
that we've been talking about
really does exist,

638
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,921
and the reason that we didn't find it
at the lab

639
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:37,216
is because it isn't at the lab,
it's at one of these properties.

640
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,259
Um...

641
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,429
I want you to...<i> </i>forget about sales.

642
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,598
I want you to come work for me
at the Hawkins PD.

643
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,517
And have to look at your face every day?
I don't think so.

644
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,144
[clattering]

645
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,105
Larry!

646
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,232
Hey!

647
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,194
Hey, where do you think you're going, pal?

648
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,278
[Larry screams]

649
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,659
-[knocking]
-[Karen] Nancy?

650
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,787
Nance?

651
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,467
[sniffles]

652
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,015
[Nancy] <i>Maybe Jonathan's right.</i>

653
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,352
To be honest, I wasn't thinking about him.

654
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,230
I wasn't thinking about anyone, really.

655
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,315
I just...

656
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,526
I wanted to be right.

657
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,905
-I wanted to be right so badly.
-And were you?

658
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,699
I thought so.

659
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:46,952
But maybe I just...

660
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,663
don't want to admit that I'm wrong,

661
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,166
-because if I'm wrong, then--
-You're what everyone thinks you are.

662
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,961
Just a kid who has no idea
what she's doing.

663
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,092
[sighs]

664
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,594
It's not easy out there, Nance.

665
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:05,679
I know.

666
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,142
People are always saying you can't.

667
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,436
That you shouldn't.

668
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,814
That you're not...

669
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,525
smart enough, not good enough.

670
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,153
[sighs]

671
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,488
This world, it...

672
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:28,285
it beats you up again and again
until eventually, I...

673
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,955
Most people, they just...

674
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,291
they just stop trying.

675
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,215
But you're not like that.

676
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,843
You're a fighter.

677
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:46,970
You always have been.

678
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,724
I honestly don't know
where you get it from. [chuckles]

679
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,225
Dad.

680
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,937
[both laugh]

681
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:01,151
I think you were swapped in the hospital,
to tell you the truth.

682
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:02,652
No.

683
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,532
I get it from you, Mom.

684
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,204
I get it from you.

685
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,461
Well, wherever you get it from,

686
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,297
I'm proud of you.

687
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,008
Proud of me for getting fired?

688
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,345
That you stood up for yourself.

689
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,430
That you stood up to those...

690
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,473
shitheads.

691
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,433
Mom!

692
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,268
Yes, those shitheads.

[chuckles, sniffles]

694
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,939
And if you believe in this story...

695
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,732
Look at me, Nancy.

696
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,610
...finish it.

697
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:49,950
Then go sell it to <i>The Indianapolis Star</i>
or whatever and...

698
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,160
I mean, can you imagine their faces

699
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,079
when they read a story
about their own town

700
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,997
in a big paper like that?

701
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,999
That would be...

702
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,794
pretty amazing.

703
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,672
So, why not?

704
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,301
Why not?

705
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,720
Finish it.

706
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,690

Uh, Will?

709
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,957
Um, you know, about yesterday...

710
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,042
It's fine, Lucas.

711
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,627
You don't have to say anything.

712
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,713
I know, but it's just...

713
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,216
It was a really cool campaign.

714
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,219
-And Mike and I, we should've never--
-I don't care anymore, Lucas.

715
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,345
I really don't.

716

We have bigger things to worry about now.

725
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,255
Hey, El...

726
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,092
I just wanted to say...

727
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,095
You know when I said Nana was sick?

728
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,473
She wasn't. I lied.

-I know.
-Right, right, right.  No, I just...

730
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,311
think it was important for you
to know the context.

731
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,647
Hopper, he went all crazy on me,

732
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,690
telling me I'm spending
way too much time with you.

733
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,609
He made me lie. I mean,

in the world.

No, no, no, no.

738

He's just some angry old man
who hates joy.

739
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,496
But if I only see you,

740
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,290
and I'm a different species than you,

741
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,418
