it is not the Starcourt Mall,

00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,848
so he can stop selling us that crap.

00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,000
Scoops Ahoy.

360
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,877
[groans]

361
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,212
[Steve] What the hell?!

362
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,047
Look at my outfit!

363
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,507
Look at my outfit!

364
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,718
You think I just wear this?!
Think I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform?

365
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,470
[groans]

366
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,388
[grunts]

367
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,806
How did you get in?

368
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,474
[gasps] I already told you.

369
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,893
I told you before. [gasps for air]

370
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,311
My delivery didn't come,

371
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,106
and my friends and I, we thought that
it was left at the loading dock,

372
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,609
so we went in the room,
and then it turned into an elevator,

373
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,195
and then... and then we dropped and then,

374
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,613
next thing we know,
I open my eyes,

375
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,532
and we're in this...

376
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,492
wonderful facility.

377
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,120
But I swear to God,

378
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,289
nobody knows about us,
nobody saw us.

379
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,832
You could just let us go, all right?

380
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,293
And I'm not gonna tell anybody about this,
okay?

381
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,919
Shit happens, life goes on.

382
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,921
And, uh... ice-- ice cream.

383
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,381
Ice cream, okay?

384
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,092
You guys know what ice cream is.
Everybody loves ice cream.

385
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,053
I don't know if you have Russian ice cream
or if that's considered gelato.

386
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,140
I don't know what's what,
but whatever you guys want, seriously.

387
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,309
USS Butterscotch,
I mean, you gotta try it.

388
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,644
It is out of this world, I'm telling ya!

389
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,149
[soldiers laughing]

390
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,611
[laughs nervously]

391
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,154
I like this guy!

392
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,825
"USS... Butterscotch." [laughs]

393
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,620
[soldiers continue laughing]

394
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,288
[chuckles]

395
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,582
[laughter stops]

396
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,252
Who do you work for?

397
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,424
Oh, come on. No, no! No, seriously--

398
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,592
[soldier grunts]

399
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,471
[soldiers speaking Russian]

400
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,018
[grunting]

401
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,519
Get your hands off me!

402
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,771
[yelps, grunts]

403
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,440
Hey...

404
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,900
Steve?

405
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,610
-[door buzzer sounds]
-Steve? Steve?

406
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,819
Steve?

407
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,073
What did you do to him? What did you do?

408
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,075
-[officer grunts]
-[Robin groans]

409
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,201
[whimpers]

410
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,786
[in Russian] Put them in the chairs.

411
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,912
[soldier speaks Russian]

412
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,581
[Robin] Don't touch me!

413
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,874
Steve-- [grunts]

414
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,584
Steve, wake up. Steve?

415
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,961
[Robin grunts, yelps]

416
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,421
What did you do?!

417
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,589
[Robin grunts]

418
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,635
Don't touch him.

419
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,969
[clicking tongue]

420
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,305
Steve? Steve, can you hear me?

421
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,350
[officer, in English] I think your friend
need a doctor.

422
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,187
Good thing...

423
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,067
we have the very best.

424
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,278
[officer laughs]

425
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,656
[soldiers laugh]

426
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,916
You are going to regret that,
little bitch.

427
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,296
[speaks Russian]

428
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,297
[door buzzer sounds]

429
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,257
Bastards.

430
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,092
Let us outta here!

431
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,345
Bastards! Let us out! Let us out!

432
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,105
[water splashing gently]

433
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,377
[ominous synth music playing]

434
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,348
[static hissing]

435
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,579
[Mike] It can't be good for her
to be in there for this long.

436
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,997
Mike, you need to relax.

437
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,499
What if she gets brain damage
or something?

438
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,794
-Oh, shit. Is that, like, a real thing?
-No, it's not. He made it up.

439
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,170
Mike doesn't know what he's talking about.

440
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,880
-Oh, and you do?
-No, I...

441
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,632
Yes, from <i>The Hawkins Post.</i>

442
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,801
I-- I called a couple days ago about the--

443
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,928
-[indistinct male voice on phone]
-Yes, yes, um...

444
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:48,307
I was just... following up
to see if anything else had gone missing,

445
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,100
or if-- Okay.

446
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,852
Um, sorry to bother--

447
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,521
[dial tone sounding]

448
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,106
[Max and Mike
argue indistinctly in background]

449
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,317
-[Nancy sighs] Who's next?
-[Jonathan] There is no next.

450
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,694
Unless you want to start calling
random people's homes.

451
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,113
-It doesn't make sense.
-What part of any of this makes sense?

452
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,408
There's a pattern, okay?
A consistency to their behavior.

453
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,786
They've been feeding on these chemicals
since this started,

454
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,663
and-- and, what, they just stop,
out of the blue?

455
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,873
Maybe they have all the chemicals
they need.

456
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,042
Maybe they've all turned into those...
things.

457
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,627
But what about the source?

458
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,381
I mean, did the Mind Flayer
just suddenly stop infecting people?

459
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,552
And even if the flayed are monsters now,
why can't El find them?

460
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,637
Okay, can you guys settle an argument
for us?

461
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,640
Who do you think should decide
El's limits?

462
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,058
Mike or Eleven?

463
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,143
The way that you frame that
is such bullshit.

464
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,813
It's not bullshit, Mike.
This is your whole problem.

465
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,274
And it's also precisely the reason why
she dumped your ass.

466
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,358
El dumped you?

467
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,569
Yeah, because she is conspiring
against me.

468
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:42,528
She's corrupting her.

469
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,779
No, enlightening her.

470
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,406
[Max] The fact is, she's not yours.

471
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,992
She's her own person,
fully capable of making her own decisions.

472
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,869
She's risking her life for no reason.

473
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:50,786
For no reason?

474
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,247
Mike, the flayed are out there
doing God knows what.

475
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,083
-Killing, flaying...
-Transforming into monsters.

476
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,501
And El's not stupid.

477
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,712
[Nancy] She knows her abilities
better than any of us.

478
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,172
-Exactly, thank you.
-And she is her own person.

479
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,591
-Exactly.
-With her own free will.

480
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:04,800
[Max] Exactly.

481
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,845
El has saved the world twice,
and Mike still doesn't trust her.

482
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,181
You wanna talk about trust, really?
After you made Eleven spy on us?

483
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,559
-Wait, what?
-Oh, she didn't tell you this?

484
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,978
-No.
-Your girlfriend used El's powers

485
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,439
-to spy on us.
-No, no, no, I did not <i>make</i> her.

486
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,648
It was <i>her </i>idea.

487
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,692
And why are we even talking about this,
seriously?

488
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,902
Yeah, who cares?

489
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:23,819
-I care.
-Yeah.

490
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,822
-I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy.
-We were just joking around.

491
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,742
Wouldn't it've been so funny if I was
taking a massive shit or something?

492
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,036
-You weren't.
-But what if I was?

493
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,704
-Then gross!
-Seriously, Mike?

494
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,582
I'm just trying to demonstrate
how careless Max is with Eleven's powers.

495
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,958
In fact, how careless all of you are.

496
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,544
You're treating her like some kind
of machine when she's not a machine,

497
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,338
and I don't want her to die
looking for the flayed

498
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,256
when they've obviously vanished
off the face of the Earth.

499
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,966
So can we please just come up
with a new plan

500
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,968
because I love her
and I can't lose her again.

501
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,265
[door opening]

502
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,770
What's going on?

503
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,480
Nothing. Nothing.

504
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,856
Just a family discussion.

505
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,149
Oh.

506
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,654
I found him.

507
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,406
Found who?

508
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:17,915
[Murray] He calls it the key,
and this key emits a great energy.

509
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,500
[Alexei speaking Russian]

510
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,670
[Murray] It requires much strength, power.

511
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,339
[Alexei speaking Russian]

512
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,424
[Murray] Those houses,
like the one you found,

513
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,135
they're located near, uh, transformers.

514
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,097
They're stealing
from your town's power grid.

515
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,475
Why build this key here? Why are they not
doing this in their own backyard?

516
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,519
What are they trying to do,
blow us to smithereens?

517
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,522
[speaking Russian]

518
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,942
[speaking Russian]

519
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:45,859
[chuckles lightly]

520
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,945
[speaking Russian]

521
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,990
There were many of these, uh, keys before
in Russia,

522
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,158
but they turned out wrong.

523
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,243
[Alexei speaking Russian]

524
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,412
They had to come to where the...
where the, uh...

525
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:57,830
Where the what?

526
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,374
-I don't understand what he's saying.
-I thought you were fluent.

527
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

528
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,378
Are my free translation services
not good enough for you?

529
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,423
Because you can just go ahead
and file your complaint

530
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,091
right up my ass!

531
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,094
What is Smirnoff doing?

532
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,014
-He's showing me.
-[speaking Russian]

533
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,183
[Murray] Oh, okay.

534
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,477
Uh, he says the straw,

535
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,939
they're using it to penetrate a hole

536
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,358
in... a box?

537
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,403
[speaking Russian]

538
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,740
Okay, sorry, sorry.

539
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,826
[Murray] The straw represents the key,
which emits a great energy.

540
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,619
[speaking Russian]

541
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,497
They're using this energy...

542
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,710
to break through a barrier,

543
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,004
to open...

544
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,422
a doorway.

545
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,425
A doorway between worlds.

546
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,308
[Alexei speaking Russian]

547
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,103
[Murray] But it seems this key
was only half the equation.

548
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,021
[speaking Russian]

549
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,356
Location-- Location was the other half.

550
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:09,985
[speaking Russian]

551
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,653
Oh, what--

552
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,781
[speaking Russian]

553
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,992
In Hawkins,
this door had been opened once.

554
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,118
[speaking Russian]

555
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,371
It was still...

556
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,707
healing.

557
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,005
Jesus Christ.

558
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,549
So, this door is open now?

559
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,343
[speaking Russian]

560
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,553
[speaking Russian]

561
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,847
He says it is...

562
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:40,724
opening.

563
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,020
-[creature shrieking]
-[fluttering sound]

564
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,855
[gasps]

565
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,942
-Where are you going?
-To call our children.

566
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,277
[gasps]

567
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,447
[in Russian]
Can we watch <i>Looney Tunes</i> now?

568
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:56,949
<i>Nyet.</i>

569
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,784
[big band music playing]

570
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,120
[panting]

571
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,371
[grumbling]

572
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,543
-Can I help you with something?
-Whiskey.

573
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,963
-You have whiskey?
-No, but I do have vodka.

574
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,926
[Hopper sighs]

575
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,445
-[Hopper inhales sharply]
-Oh!

576
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,534
If there's a way to start this key,
there's gotta be a way to stop it, yeah?

577
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,869
Turn it off?

578
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,541
-[Hopper inhales sharply]
-[Murray sighs]

579
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,126
-Right.
-Right?

580
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,132
[in Russian]
The key, is there a way to turn it off?

581
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,051
[speaking Russian]

582
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,554
[in English] He says,
"Of course he could turn it off. Could...

583
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,974
Edison not turn off a lamp,
could Bell not hang up a phone?"

584
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,185
Cocky bastard. "But..."

585
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,603
But what?

586
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,645
[speaking Russian]

587
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,897
But he is now...

588
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:11,565
"naked."

589
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,986
Sorry, "exposed." Compromised.

590
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,281
Hey, I will get you there.

591
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,326
I will get you to your key.

592
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,745
[speaking Russian]

593
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,959
[laughs]

594
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,716
You wanna ask him what the hell's
so funny about that?

595
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,343
[speaking Russian]

596
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,802
[speaking Russian]

597
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,017
He says he likes your courage.

598
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:48,602
You remind him of a...

599
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,770
[clears throat]

600
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,230
...fat Rambo.

601
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,858
[Alexei speaking Russian]

602
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,819
[Murray] But he says that even thin Rambo
couldn't get there.

603
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:58,987
[Alexei speaking Russian]

604
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,574
This key, it is in an underground fortress

605
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,994
designed by the greatest Russian minds,

606
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,956
guarded by their greatest warriors.

607
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,625
[speaking Russian]

608
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,001
[Murray] Breaking in is...

609
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,170
impossible.

610
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,225
Jackpot.

611
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,570
[Dustin] Oh-ho-ho!

612
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,657
Do you even know how to drive?

613
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,742
How hard can it be? Max did it.

614
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,203
-[Dustin] Aw, come on.
-You seriously thought

615
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,706
-they'd just leave keys in there?
-There's gotta be a spare.

616
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,748
[Erica sighs]

617
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,135
-[Erica] Hey, Dustin?
-Yeah?

618
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,346
How big did you say that Demogorgon was?

619
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,307
Big. Nine feet or so. Why?

620
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:21,945
Found 'em.

621
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,282
Erica?

622
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,283
[loud zapping]

623
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,576
What the hell is that?!

624
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,869
A deadly weapon.

625
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,203
Could be useful.

626
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,415
-For what?
-What do you think?

627
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,667
Taking down Commies, saving your friends.

628
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,961
Thought you were more realistic than that,
nerd.

629
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,713
We don't even know where they are,

630
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,923
and even if we did,
there are a million guards up there

631
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,842
with weapons way deadlier than that.

632
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,679
The best thing we can do for them
is to get out of here and find help.

633
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:48,722
Easy with that.

634
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,558
Our chance of surviving, and theirs,
rises substantially.

635
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,560
Just trust me on this. Please?

636
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,815
[engine powering up]

637
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,069
[Robin] Help!

638
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,653
[Robin's voice echoes]

639
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,238
Help!

640
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:10,035
-Help!
-Hey, would you stop yelling?

641
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,703
Steve! Oh, my God!

642
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:13,455
[panting] Steve...

643
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,957
Are-- Are you okay?

644
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,251
My ears are ringing,
and I can't really breathe,

645
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,462
my eye feels
like it's about to pop out of my skull,

646
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:24,132
but, you know, apart from that,
I'm doing pretty good.

647
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:28,011
Well, the good news is that
they're calling you a doctor.

648
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,429
[Robin chuckles]

649
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,391
Is this his place of work?

650
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,101
-I love the vibe.
-[Robin chuckles]

651
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,018
Charming.

652
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:37,521
Yeah, tell me about it. So, okay,

653
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,524
do you see that table over there
to your right? No, your other right.

654
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,900
-Oh.
-Yeah, okay.

655
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,319
-And do you see those scissors?
-Uh-huh.

656
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:48,323
Yeah, well, I think that if we move
at the same time, we could get over there,

657
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,951
and then maybe I could kick the table
and knock them into your lap.

658
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,453
-And I could cut the binds.
-Yeah, and we could get out of here.

659
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,539
-Gotcha. Okay, yeah, we can do that.
-Yeah.

660
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,207
Those morons. They left scissors in here?

661
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,209
-Yeah, morons. [laughs]
-Total morons.

662
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,044
-Okay.
-Okay, so,

663
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,963
on the count of three, we're gonna hop.

664
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,340
-Okay, good, hop on three. I gotcha.
-All right.

665
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,926
One, two, three.

666
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,096
-Okay, that worked.
-Okay.

667
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,681
-All right. Uh, let's try again.
-Right.

668
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,433
[both] One, two, three.

669
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,060
-Holy shit, this is gonna work!
-We're close. Ready?

670
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,312
Okay, one, two, three.

671
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,564
[both grunting]

672
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,565
[both groaning]

00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,985
[laughing lightly]

674
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,112
It's okay, it's okay.

675
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,822
Don't cry. Robin.

676
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,199
[Robin giggles]

677
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,951
Are you laughing?

678
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,035
[continues laughing]

679
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,580
-Yeah.
-Jesus!

680
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,248
I'm sorry!

681
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,085
I'm so sorry. It's just...

682
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,920
I can't believe...

683
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,257
I'm gonna die in a secret Russian base

684
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,842
with Steve "The Hair" Harrington.

685
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,761
-It's just too trippy, man.
-We're not gonna die.

686
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,305
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

687
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,640
Just-- You gotta let me
just think for a second.

688
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,479
Do you remember, um,
Mrs. Click's sophomore history class?

689
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,857
What?

690
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,775
Mrs. Clickity-Clackity.

691
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,528
That's what us band dweebs called her.

692
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,490
-[sighs]
-It was first period,

693
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,660
Tuesdays and Thursdays,
so you were always late.

694
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,748
And you always had the same breakfast.

695
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:23,460
Bacon, egg, and cheese
on a sesame bagel.

696
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,795
I sat behind you

697
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,715
two days a week for a year.

698
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:30,675
Mister Funny.

699
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,594
Mister Cool.

700
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,680
The King of Hawkins High himself.

701
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,185
Do you even remember me
from that class?

702
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,522
[Robin chuckles]

703
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,357
Of course you don't.

704
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,985
You were a real asshole, you know that?

705
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,487
Yeah, I know.

706
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,447
But it didn't even matter.

707
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,241
It didn't matter that you were an ass.

708
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:55,784
I was still...

709
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,827
obsessed with you.

710
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,997
Even though all of us losers
pretend to be above it all,

711
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,458
we still just wanna be popular...

712
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,211
accepted,

713
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:07,462
normal.

714
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:11,424
If it makes you feel any better,
having those things isn't all that great.

715
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,009
Seriously.

716
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,011
[sighs] It just baffles me.

717
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,430
Everything that people tell you
is important,

718
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,684
everything that people say
you should care about, it's all just...

719
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,685
[chuckles]

720
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,145
...bullshit.

721
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,692
But I guess you gotta mess up
to figure things out, right?

722
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,901
I hope so.

723
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,320
I feel like my whole life has been...

724
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,864
one big error.

725
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,074
[chuckles]

726
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,201
Yep. [laughs]

727
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,787
At least it can't get any more messed up
than this.

728
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,247
[both chuckle]

729
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,332
You know, I wish I'd known you
in Click's class.

730
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,293
-Yeah?
-Really, I do.

731
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,335
[Robin chuckles]

732
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,462
Maybe you could've helped me
pass the class.

733
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,383
Maybe instead of being here,
I'd be on my way to college right now.

734
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,011
And I would have no idea

735
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,471
that there were evil Russians
beneath our feet,

736
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:02,601
and I would be happily slinging ice cream
with some other schmuck.

737
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,561
[both chuckle]

738
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:06,605
Gotta say, though,

739
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,356
I liked being your schmuck.

740
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,984
It was fun while it lasted.

741
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,069
It was.

742
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,322
-[buzzer sounds]
-[door opens]

743
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,574
[suspenseful music playing]

744
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,659
[chuckles]

745
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,745
Where were you two going?

746
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,748
[clicking tongue]

747
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,341
Try telling the truth this time, yes?

748
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:38,595
It will make your visit with Dr. Zharkov
less painful.

749
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,889
[winces]

750
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:43,600
[chuckles]

751
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,773
Wait a second. Wait. Hold on.

752
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,941
Okay! Wait, wait, wait!
What is that thing?

753
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,568
It will help you talk.

754
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,362
Did you even clean that thing?!

755
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,322
[screams]

756
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,324
[static hissing]

757
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,795
[gasping breaths]

758
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,010
[Eleven breathes rapidly]

759
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:23,223
[gasping, panting]

760
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,849
What's he doing now?

761
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,777
[Nancy] And that's not normal, right?

762
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,196
Billy staying in his room
on the Fourth of July?

763
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,614
No, that's not normal.

764
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,658
He wants us to find him.

765
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,159
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

766
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:46,788
If we go to Billy, then the rest
of the flayed know where we are.

767
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,998
It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed.

768
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,208
We won't be surprised.

769
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,295
We'll know that they're coming,
and we will kick their flayed butts.

770
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,131
You mean El will kick their butts.

771
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,599
[Eleven's voice echoes] <i>Papa!</i>

772
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:07,600
No.

<i>Sunflower. Rainbow.</i>

775
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,610
-[Mike] It's too risky.
-[Nancy] Yeah, and unnecessary.

776
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,863
Killing the flayed
won't stop the Mind Flayer.

777
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,823
We have to find out where
it's spreading from.

778
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,867
We have to find the source.

779
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,034
[Eleven] Billy knows it.

780
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,578
Billy's been there.

781
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,080
To the source.

782
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,458
-Yeah, but--
-It's a trap. I know.

783
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:34,002
[Eleven] We can't go to Billy,

784
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:38,089
but I think there's another way.

785
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,259
A way for me to see where he's been.

786
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,181
[static hissing]

787
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,562
El, I know you think you have to do this,
but you don't.

788
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,732
It's just,
you've only done this before once.

789
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,359
And your mom, she loved you,

790
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,612
and wanted you to know what happened.

791
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,239
And Billy's mind is-- is sick, diseased.

792
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,283
The Mind Flayer is in him.

793
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:07,994
He can't hurt me.

794
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,579
Not in there.

795
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,705
We don't know that.

796
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,709
Mike.

797
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,755
I need you to trust me.

798
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,344
Yeah.

799
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,095
Just... be careful.

800
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,032
[shivering breaths]

801
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:07,929
[Eleven exhales sharply]

802
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,619
[echoing] Billy.

803
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,833
Can you hear me?

804
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,712
I want to see.

805
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,214
I want to see what happened.

[whimpering]

808
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,058
Something's wrong.

809
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,482
[screams] Stop! No! No! No!

810
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,692
No!

Are you okay?

821
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:48,863
[softly] I'm okay.

822
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,448
What's going on?

823
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,992
I'm... on a beach.

824
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,703
[Lucas] Okay, I may be dense,

825
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,538
but the last I checked,

826
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,291
there weren't any beaches in Hawkins.

827
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,251
What else do you see?

828
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,254

pretty.

I...

834
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,688

Did you see that?

Yeah, I saw that!

844
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,041
That was at least seven feet.

845
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,669
[woman] I don't know what it was,
but it almost gave me a heart attack.

Ten more minutes?

-Yeah, okay, ten more minutes.
-Okay.

00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,260
But any longer than that,
Dad's gonna be mad, okay?

I know.

It's Billy.

It's California.

than that and they could trace you.

Yeah, I want 'em to trace me.

Identification code?

You don't know it?

Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it.

880
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,176
[chuckles] I got it.

881
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,638
You wrote it down and kept it
in your wallet?

Now, he'll know what that means.

885
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,607
Not about the Russkies,
but about the gate.

886
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,735
Tell him that there's an entrance
at Starcourt Mall.

Have him call me back here
at 618-625-8313.

00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,244
Your message will be relayed.

00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,835
we wait.

893
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,169
You compromised me, Jim.

894
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,922
You do realize that, don't you?
I'm gonna have to relocate.

895
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,049
-How long do we wait?
-As long as it takes.

896
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,385
How can you just sit there being calm?

897
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,970
I am not calm!

898
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,721
Our kids are in danger!

899
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,807
You said they were at the festival!

900
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,810
Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate!

901
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:07,979
[scoffs]

902
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,690
What are you doing? Joyce?

903
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,191
What are you doing?

904
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,359
[phone rings]

905
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,736
Philadelphia Public Library.

906
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,863
Yes, hello.

907
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,824
Uh, this is,
uh, Antique Chariot's partner...

908
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,576
Wheelbarrow.

909
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,703
<i>I don't think Antique Chariot</i>

910
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:27,039
properly conveyed the urgency
of our situation.

911
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,374
What are you doing?

912
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,459
Can't just sit around and wait for a call.

913
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,753
-Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm.
<i>-No.</i>

914
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,339
Don't you dare patronize me!

915
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,216
<i>I don't know who you are,</i>

916
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,969
if you're some glorified secretary
or what,

917
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,097
but if you don't wanna lose your job,
here's what's gonna happen.

918
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,390
When I hang up,

919
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,100
you're gonna get up off your ass,

920
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,811
<i>and you're gonna go find Owens</i>
<i>and tell him what's going on.</i>

921
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:52,106
We don't have time to talk about it
and neither does he.

922
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:56,402
He's gotta get to Hawkins,
and he's gotta bring his men right now!

923
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,987
Do you understand me?

924
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,238
Yes, yes, ma'am.

925
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,490
Thank you. And good day.

926
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,286
It's been exactly one minute, Joyce.

927
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,913
That's one minute too long.

928
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,208
-Alexei.
-[gasps]

929
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,500
[in Russian] What's going on?

930
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,044
We gotta go. Vroom, vroom.

931
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,670
Back to Hawkins. Come on.

932
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,172
[Joyce] Come on.

933
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,688
Honestly, I don't really feel anything.

934
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,357
Do you?

935
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,568
I mean, I... I feel fine.

936
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,154
-I feel normal.
-Yeah, I feel-- I feel fine.

937
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:42,657
I kinda feel good.

938
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,533
[both chuckling]

939
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,911
-Wanna know a secret?
-What?

940
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,246
I like it, too!

941
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,373
[both laugh]

942
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:53,584
-I feel good.
-Morons. They messed up the drug.

943
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:55,086
They messed it up!

944
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,048
-Morons. Hey, morons!
-Morons!

945
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,716
-Moron! Mor--
-Hey!

946
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,051
Whoa-oh!

947
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,971
Oh, no. There's definitely
something wrong with us.

948
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,889
-Something's wrong.
-[door buzzer sounds]

949
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,362
[Robin chuckles]

950
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,993
Would now be a good time to tell you
that I don't like doctors?

951
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,956
Let's try this again, yes?

952
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,708
[murmurs]

953
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,251
Who do you work for?

954
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,461
Scoops. [chuckles]

955
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,421
Scoops Ahoy.

956
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,464
[giggles]

957
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,300
How did you find us?

958
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:43,843
Totally by accident. [chuckles]

959
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,303
[Steve chuckles]

960
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:46,345
[in Russian] More lies.

961
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,061
-What is that shiny little toy?
-[Robin] Where you going with that, doc?

962
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:57,023
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
Wait! No! Wait! Wait!

963
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:59,608
-Whoa!
-There was a code! We heard a code!

964
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,152
Code.

965
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:03,237
What code?

966
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:04,530
"The week is long.

967
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,991
The silver cat feeds
when blue meets yellow in the west."

968
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,200
Blah, blah, blah.

969
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:13,414
You broadcast that stupid spy shit
all over town,

970
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,874
and we picked it up on our Cerebro,

971
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,418
and we cracked it in a day.

972
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,003
A day!

973
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,505
You think you're so smart,

974
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:25,509
but a couple of kids
who scoop ice cream for a living

975
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,888
cracked your code in a day,
and now, people know you're here.

976
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,015
Who knows we are here, little bitch?

977
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,224
Uh, well, Dustin knows.

978
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:33,434
Hey, Steve?

979
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,686
-Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows.
-Steve!

980
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,855
-[Steve laughs]
-Dustin Henderson.

981
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,025
It is your small, curly-haired friend?

982
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:44,195
Oh, curly-haired. Great hair. Small.
Kind of like a 'fro. Yeah.

983
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,237
Where is he?

984
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,948
He's long gone, you big asshole.

985
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,533
And he's probably calling Hopper,

986
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,828
and Hopper's calling the US cavalry.
[laughs]

987
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:56,207
They're gonna come in here,
commando-style, guns a-blazin',

988
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,125
and kick your sorry asses back to Russia.

989
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,710
You're gonna be two pieces of toast.

990
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,296
[snickers]

991
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,092
Is that so?

992
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:07,009
Yeah.

993
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,344
[both laugh]

994
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,138

1005
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:44,588
Hey! Henderson!

1006
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,590
That's crazy,
I was just talking about you.

1007
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,634
-Oh, my God!
-Get ready to run.

1008
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,303

1011
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,748
[man] Hey! Billy, stop!

1012
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:22,501
What the hell is wrong with you?
What did we talk about, huh?

1013
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:23,461
You gotta slide!

1014
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,754
-[stammering] I know.
-Wait.

1015
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,174
-Afraid you're gonna get hurt, is that it?
-No.

1016
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,718
[man] Well, what then? What?

1017
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,053
What did I raise, a pussy for a son?

1018
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,097
-Leave me alone!
-Hey!

1019
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,933
[man] That's right, run!
Like you always do!

Where were you?

1023

-[woman] I told you, I was with Wendy.
-[man] Stop lying to me!

1024
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:56,535

-You saw him again, didn't you?

1025
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,829
-Didn't you?!
-Get away from me!

1026
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,749
-I said, get away!
-You-- You whore!

1027
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,833
-Stop it!
-Bitch!

1028

-Don't hurt her!
-No!

[young Billy] I don't understand. Why not?

1033
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,594
Please, Mom, don't do this.

1034
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,803
Please come home.

1035
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:18,891
No. How long? How long?!

Get up! What, are you scared to fight me?

1040
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,442
You scared?

1041
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:32,112
Get up and fight me, pussy! Pussy!

1042
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,448
[man] Billy, come over here,
I want you to meet someone.

1043
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:37,785
This is your new sister.
Her name's Maxine.

1044
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,286
Max.

1045
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:41,789
-Shake her hand.
-[Billy] Who's there?

1046
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:45,167
-[man] I said, shake her hand.
-[Billy] I said, who's there?! [screams]

1053
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:36,844
I think I found it.

1054

[Eleven panting]

1055
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:39,096
The source.

1056
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,723
Where, El? Where are you?

1057
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:47,646
Brimborn...

1058
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,648
Steelworks.

Here. Okay, uh, steelworks, steelworks...

1060
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,365
Uh...

00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:00,492
Here, steel.

1062
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:01,702
Uh...

1063
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,121
[Jonathan] Found it.
6522 Cherry Oak Drive.

1064
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,790
-That's close.
-El, El, we found it. Get out of there.

1065
