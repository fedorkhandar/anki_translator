-[Max] That doesn't look like a bowl.

Nah, it's way better.

421
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,323
There is a reason this warning label
says "18 or older."

I like that you and Max are friends now.

449

It's just, I was jealous at first,
and-- and angry.

450

And that's why I said
all that stupid stuff.

And it's like I wanted you all to myself.

452

And now I realize how unfair that is.

453

[Hopper yells]

545
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,355
Stay here,
go over the plans with Smirnoff.

546
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,941
-I can help look.
-No, you'll scare the children.

-Jim, if this is about earlier--
-Stay put, Freud!

548

00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,078
You know,
say what you will about Kline,

552
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,414
he certainly knows how to throw a party.

553
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,332
I'm sorry about him, by the way.

554
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,917
-Who, Larry?
-No, Murray.

555
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,795
He's a sick individual
who likes to get under people's skin.

556
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:50,090
So, let's not let him, you know,
get under our skin.

557
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,258
I'm not, I haven't.

558
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,218
I just, you seem
a little more quiet than usual.

559
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,429
-I just-- I just wanna find the kids.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

560
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,847
[Larry] I'll give it my best shot.

[Mike and Max] What?

579
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,122
It's like Carpenter's <i>The Thing.</i>

580
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,915
The original is a classic,

581
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,500
no question about it.

582
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,293

Sweeter, bolder...

587
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:22,766
better.

588
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,143
You're insane.

589
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,812
So, you prefer the original <i>Thing?</i>

590
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,149
What? No, I'm not talking about <i>The Thing,</i>
I'm talking about New Coke.

591
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,650
It's the same concept, dude.

592
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,402
Uh, actually, it's not the same concept.

593
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,611
It is the same concept.

594
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,029
-No, it's not.
-[yells] Yes, it is.

595
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,197
Hey.

596
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,824
Sorry.

597
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,075
Sorry.

598
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,580
Did you... find him?

[Lucas] The movies?

600
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,754
Dustin's so freaked out about the gate,
he decides to go watch a movie?

601
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,047
Yeah, makes total sense.

602
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,133
You're positive he said "gate"
and not "great"?

603
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,051
Yeah, like,
"This movie I'm watching is great."

604
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:58,969
Sounded like "gate."

605

Which would explain how
the Mind Flayer's still alive.

-Yeah, we just have to shut it again.
-Then the monster dies.

But if not,
we always have Lucas' fireworks.

Keep mocking my plan, Max.
Keep mocking it.

609
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,356
I wanna hear you say it again,
because you keep doubting me.

610

You keep doubting me!

-[Max] Ridiculous.
-[Lucas] Will?

The ceiling stopped spinning for me.

617
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,966
Is it still spinning for you?

618
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,637
Holy shit.

619
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:43,472
No.

620
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,849
You think we puked it all up?

621
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,268
Maybe. Ask me something.

622
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,062
[in Russian accent] Interrogate me.

623
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,813
Okay. Interrogate you. Sure.

Um...

00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,443
When was the last time
you, uh, peed your pants?

626
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,694
Today.

It was just a little bit, though.

-Okay.

Hit me.

Have you...

638
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,759
ever been in love?

639
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,137
Yep. Nancy Wheeler.

Oh, my God.

643
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,270
She's such a priss.

644
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:32,729
[Steve] Hm.

645
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,148
Turns out, not really.

646
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,443
[scoffs]
Are you still in love with Nancy?

647
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,030
-No.
-Why not?

648
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,494
I think it's because I found someone
who's a little bit better for me.

649
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,579
[chuckles] It's crazy.

650
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,332
Ever since Dustin got home,
he's been saying,

651
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,210
"You know, you gotta find your Suzie.
You gotta find your Suzie."

652
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,628
Wait, who's Suzie?

653
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,464
It's some girl from camp,
I guess his girlfriend.

654
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,884
To be honest with you,
I'm not 100% sure she's even real.

655
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,722
But that's not--
that's not really the point.

656
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,766
That doesn't matter. The point is,
this girl, you know, the one that I like,

657
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:15,063
it's somebody that I...
didn't even talk to in school.

658
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,150
And I don't even know why.

659
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,111
Maybe 'cause Tommy H.
would've made fun of me or...

660
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,488
I wouldn't be...

661
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,699
prom king.

662
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,038
It's stupid. I mean, Dustin's right,
it's all just a bunch of bullshit anyways.

663
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,414
Because, when I think about it,

664
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,791
I should've been hanging out
with this girl the whole time.

665
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,210
First of all, she's hilarious.
She's so funny.

666
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:40,172
I feel like, this summer,
I have laughed harder

667
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,506
than I have laughed...

668
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,675
in a really long time.

669
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,093
And she's smart.

670
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,888
Way smarter than me.

671
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,434
You know, she can crack, like,
top secret Russian codes and...

672
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:57,147
You know? She's honestly unlike anyone
I've ever even met before.

673
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,403
Robin?

[tapping on stall]

675
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,285
Robin, did you just OD in there?

676
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,537
No. [sighs]

677
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,206
I...

678
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,458
am still alive.

680
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,136
[Robin] The floor's disgusting.

681
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,307
Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood
and puke on my shirt, so...

682
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:35,852
What do you think?

683
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,813
About?

684
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,564
This girl.

685
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:40,941
She sounds awesome.

686
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,735
She is awesome. And what about the guy?

687
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,988
I think he's on drugs,
and he's not thinking straight.

688
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,783
Really? 'Cause I think he's thinking
a lot more clearly than usual.

689
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,243
He's not.

690
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,287
Look...

691
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,125
he doesn't even know this girl.

692
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,293
And if he did know her,

693
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,129
like-- like really know her,

694
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,674
I don't think he'd even want to be
her friend.

695
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,176
No, that's not true. No way is that true.

696
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,845
Listen to me, Steve.

697
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,389
It's shocked me to my core,

698
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,391
but I like you.

699
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,685
I really like you.

700
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,229
But I'm not like your other friends.

701
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,691
And I'm not like Nancy Wheeler.

702
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,860
Robin, that's exactly why I like you.

703
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:25,819
[Robin scoffs]

704
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,447
Do you remember what I said
about Click's class?

705
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,992
About me being jealous and, like,
obsessed?

706
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:33,660
Yeah.

707
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,997
It isn't because I had a crush on you.

708
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,208
It's because...

709
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,879
