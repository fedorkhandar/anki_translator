00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,505
The music.
The music right there at the end.

361
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,632
Why are you listening to the music, Steve?

362
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:12,717
Listen to the Russian!

363
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,469
-We're translating Russian!
-I'm trying to listen to the Russian,

364
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,805
-but there's music--
-All right, babysitting time is over.

365
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:18,931
You need to get in there.

366
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,934
Hey, my board.
That was important data, shitbirds.

367
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,479
I guarantee you, what we're doing
is way more important than your data.

368
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,649
Yeah? And how do you know these Russians
are up to no good anyways?

369
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,402
-How does she know about the Russians?
-I don't know.

370
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,945
-You told her about--
-It wasn't me.

371
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,157
Hello, I can hear you.
Actually, I can hear everything.

372
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,451
You are both extremely loud.

373
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:42,330
You think you have evil Russians
plotting against our country, on tape,

374
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,832
and you're trying to translate,
but haven't figured out a word

375
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,752
because you didn't realize Russians
use an entirely different alphabet.

376
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,545
Sound about right?

377
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,841
-Whoa! What do you think you're doing?
-I wanna hear it.

378
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,926
-[both] Why?
-'Cause maybe I can help.

379
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,721
-I'm fluent in four languages, you know.
-Russian?

380
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,598
<i>Ou-yay are-yay umb-day.</i>

381
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,016
[laughs] Oh-ho-ho!

382
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:02,933
Holy shit!

383
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,560
That was Pig Latin, dingus.

384
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,355
-Idiot.
-But I can speak Spanish

385
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,399
and French and Italian,
and I've been in band for 12 years.

386
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,985
-My ears are little geniuses, trust me.
-Uh...

387
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,696
Come on, it's your turn
to sling ice cream, my turn to translate.

388
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,948
I don't even want credit. I'm just bored.

389
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,909
[bell dings at counter]

390
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,758
[light jazz playing]

391
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:38,803
Yes?

392
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,180
-Mrs. Driscoll?
-Yes?

393
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,057
Hi, um, I'm Nancy.

394
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,227
Nancy Wheeler.
We spoke briefly on the phone last night.

395
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,436
We're from <i>The Hawkins Post.</i>

396
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,146
Oh! Oh, yes!

397
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,439
Oh, my goodness.

398
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,109
Oh. You look too young for reporters.

399
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,778
-We get that a lot.
-[Mrs. Driscoll chuckles]

400
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,696
Follow me.

401
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,032
[Nancy] Oh, it's... it's lovely.

402
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,536
Um, do you live here all alone?

403
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,830
Yes. Jack, my husband,

404
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,542
he passed away, what is it now,
ten years ago.

405
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,503
Oh, um... I'm... I'm so sorry.

406
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,213
Oh, don't be.

407
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,298
I kinda like the quiet.

408
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,426
At least, I did.

409
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,553
[door hinge creaks]

410
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,887
This way.

411
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,767
[steps creaking]

412
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,691
It's right over there.

413
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,418
[Mrs. Driscoll] You see those
little teeth marks, don't ya?

414
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:57,298
And...

415
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:58,841
these bags, um...

416
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,343
you're sure they were full before?

417
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,845
I'm old, honey, not senile.

418
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,974
Bought them over at Blackburn's Supplies
just last Tuesday.

419
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,225
Now you tell me,

420
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,729
why would rats want to eat
a poor old woman's fertilizer?

421
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,980
Are you sure they did?

422
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:17,276
Maybe they just gnawed the bag? I mean...

423
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,278
eating fertilizer seems--

424
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,363
Crazy. Believe me, I know, honey.

425
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,324
But... [sighs]

426
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,701
...something's not right with these rats.

427
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,286
What does that mean, exactly...

428
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:28,996
"not right"?

429
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,123
Rabies, my guess.

430
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,792
That's when I said to myself,

431
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,877
"Doris, you gotta call the paper.

432
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,214
Because if those diseased rats
are runnin' loose,

433
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,925
the people, they oughta know."
Wouldn't you agree?

434
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,093
[crashing sound]

435
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,638
Oh, yes, I forgot to mention!

436
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,848
Come on over here.

437
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,102
-[thud]
-[loud squeal]

438
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,979
I caught one of the little bastards.

00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,482
[monstrous chittering]

440
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,820

Kline's a swine!

442

Kline's a swine!

443
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,410
Kline's a swine! Kline's a swine!

444

Kline's a swine!

448
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,295
Kline's a swine!

449
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,588
Kline's a swine!

[woman] Jim?

452
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,718
Mayor Kline is ready for you.

453
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:27,847
Great.

454
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,724
Thank you.

455
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,643
Jim.

456
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,813
[chuckles] Thanks for coming by.

457
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,189
I'm not doing it, Larry.

458
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,315
[laughs]

459
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,943
Calm down, now.
You don't even know what I want.

460
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,196
You don't like your fan club, you want me
to shut 'em down. Sound about right?

461
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,657
[laughs] When'd you get so serious?

462
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,784
Take a seat.

[grunts]

466
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,167
My fan club, as you call them,

467
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,211
now, you know why they're out there,
don't ya?

468
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,754
They're not actually fans?

469
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:01,839
[chuckles]

470
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,924
They lost their jobs to the mall

471
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,135
and blame me for helping make that happen.

472
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,052
Now,

473
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,054
you go ask anyone else in this town.

474
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,556
They all love the mall.

475
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,183
It's helped our economy grow,
brought in new jobs,

476
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,227
and just some incredible new stores.

477
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,982
Which is why they all stopped shopping
at their, uh, mom-and-pops.

478
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,609
Now, that's not me, Jim.

479
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:22,610
-Mm-hmm?
-Uh-uh.

480
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,237
That's just, uh, good old fashioned
American capitalism.

481
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,823
Well, Larry,
I think that they're just exercising

482
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:31,452
their good old fashioned American right
to protest.

483
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,329
-[grunts]
-I agree.

484
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,080
-Yeah.
-If.

485
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,708
If they had a permit.

486
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,419
Now, correct me if I'm wrong here, Jim,
but, uh...

487
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,631
I don't believe they secured a permit
from your office,

488
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,382
did they?

489
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,676
Not that I'm aware of.

490
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,971
Then I do believe it's within my right
to get rid of them.

491
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:52,806
Larry,

492
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,642
I'm not a politics guy,

493
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:58,312
but I think if you force those people
out of here without provocation,

494
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,023
I don't think that's a good look
for your re-election campaign.

["America the Beautiful" playing]

496
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,903
You know what's in four days, Jim?

Independence Day?

498
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,239
That's right.

499
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,201
And I'm gonna throw this town
the biggest bash it's ever seen.

500
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,578
Fireworks, music, activities, you name it.

501
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,664
I'm gonna pull out all the stops.
You know why?

502
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,709
'Cause at the end of the day,
that's all the voters will remember.

with all that racket going on out there.

So, if you don't mind,

506
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,013
please...

00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,640

Hey, what's wrong?

513

gonna have to try everything.
