186
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,633
Yes, <i>magnit.</i>

187
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,427
Okay, so, uh, <i>magnit...</i>

188
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,053
on my-- my fridge,

189
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,555
my icebox, and then they...

190
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,348
they fell.

191
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,310
They demagnetized, stopped working.
Uh, do you understand?

192
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,227
<i>Da.</i>

193
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,106
Okay, so is that because of the machines
that you're working on?

194
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,192
<i>-Machina.</i>
-<i>Machina, machina,</i> yes.

195
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,276
[imitates revving engine]

196
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,360
<i>Da, da, machina.</i>

197
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,321
<i>-Machina, machina!</i>
-Yes, <i>machina--</i>

198
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,322
Vroom, vroom.

199
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,157
Oh, not-- not the car.

200
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,576
The machines at Hess Farm where--

201
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,037
-where we kidnapped you--
-Joyce, please!

202
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,080
You're givin' me a headache, both of you!

203
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,916
Hold on, please. One minute.

204
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,000
[Joyce] Hey.

205
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,752
I am making progress.

206
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,212
-Progress.
-Yeah.

207
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,839
What have you learned, huh?
You learned that Smirnoff over there--

208
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,300
-[Joyce] Alexei.
-Smirnoff is Russian

209
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,927
and works for Starcourt,

210
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,220
two things we already knew.

211
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,137
Thought we knew.

212
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,098
But now we know-know,
because I've confirmed them.

213
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,183
You're welcome.

214
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,770
Yeah? Why don't you confirm
whether this baby'll start, huh?

215
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,814
-[Hopper] Keep it in park, please.
-Yeah, duh!

216
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,025
You do-- do something useful.

217
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,027
-You do something useful.
-[sighs]

00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,487

[sighs]

222
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,535
It's not working.

223
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,412
Try it again.

224
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,122
[engine turns over]

225
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,123
Shit.

-[electric crackling]
-Hey. Hey. [speaking Russian]

228
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,049
Stop, stop!

229
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,217
Shut up, Smirnoff!

230
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,843
[speaking Russian rapidly]

231
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,762
Aw, come on! D'you hear me?

232
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,264
I said shut your damn--

233
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:45,974
[high-pitched squealing]

234
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,016
Shit!

235
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,268
Oh, Jesus.

236
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,394
[Joyce gasps]

237
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,729
[Hopper] Whoa!

238
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,106
[gasps]

239
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:56,985
Stop.

240
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,864
[Joyce] I thought this friend of yours
lived in Illinois.

241
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,284
He's not really a friend.
He's more like an acquaintance.

242
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,576
Oh? Okay, well--

243
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,371
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Keep up, keep up, keep up.

244
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,747
-Easy.
-[insects buzzing]

245
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,041
Okay, so this acquaintance...

246
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,794
-lives in Illinois? Correct?
-[Hopper] Yeah, yeah.

247
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,754
[Joyce] So we're walking to Illinois?

248
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,756
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna walk to Illinois.

249
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,134
You know, I figure we'll get there
by, like, Friday evening.

250
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,386
I hope that works for your schedule.
Jesus Christ, Joyce.

251
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,055
-We're not walking to Illinois, okay?
-Well, then what are we doing?

252
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,098
I don't know, okay?

253
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,350
I will-- I will figure something out.

254
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,478
Isn't there someone in Indiana
who speaks Russian that--

255
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,564
You know what? I'm all ears, Joyce.

256
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,481
I'm all ears.

257
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,399
I'm all ears!

258
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,526
[Joyce] I mean, fine.

259
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,111
Just saying.

260
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,195
Gah!

261
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,405
Ugh!

262
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,408
Gah!

263
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,660
[sighs]

264
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,043
[Hopper] Damn it.

265
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,004
I found him.

266
00:13:59,005 --> 00:13:59,964
[Max] Where is he?

267
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,467
Woods.

268
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,926
-[TV static hissing]
-Woods?

269
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,012
He's with... Will's mom.

270
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,680
My-- My mom?

271
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,515
What are they doing?

272
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,392
Ill... annoy.

273
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,562
They're going to Ill-annoy.

274
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,356
-[knocking on door]
-[Karen] Mike! Breakfast!

275
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,732
Not now, Mom!

276
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,443
Illinois? Illinois, like the state?

277
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,153
The state of Illinois?

278
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,489
[stammers] Ill-annoy.

279
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,451
[tap stops]

280
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,750
[Max] Does it still hurt?

281
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,211
Only when I talk.

282
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,922
Well, it's a good thing
you're not Mike, then.

283
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,800
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
And you'd be in constant pain.

284
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,301
[both chuckle]

285
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,097
[Mike]<i> </i>Something's not right.
I can't get Hopper off my back all summer,

286
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,808
now all of a sudden,
he's hiking with Will's mom to Illinois?

287
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,351
And Dustin's MIA, too?

288
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,311
I mean, this can't be a coincidence.

289
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,437
What does it matter?

290
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,731
The bottom line is, they're not here.

291
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,734
-It's up to us.
-Up to us to do what exactly?

292
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,361
Find Billy and stop him.

293
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,196
Okay, yeah,
that's a really nice sentiment,

294
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,616
but even if El could find him again,
and that's a pretty big if, then what?

295
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,411
We burn the shit out of him
and make sure he doesn't escape this time.

296
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,246
-Okay, then what?
-Then we win.

297
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,872
No, see, that's the problem.

298
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,874
We don't. We don't win.

299
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,627
We got the Mind Flayer out of Will before
and he just came right back.

300
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,547
We don't just have to stop Billy,
we have to stop the Mind Flayer.

301
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,465
-How in the hell do we do that?
-I don't know.

302
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,675
Maybe El does.

303
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,222
What are they still doing in there?

304
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,016
I don't know.

305
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,436
Girls just like hanging out in bathrooms.

306
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,479
Why?

307
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,024
-I mean, I don't know.
-They're conspiring against me.

308
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,819
-That's what you're concerned about now?
-It's not my main concern.

309
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,113
-It's just a sub-concern.
-I thought it was already over.

310
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,365
It's not over, okay?
We're just taking a break.

311
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,992
She said she dumped your ass.

312
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,202
-That doesn't sound like a break.
-[Max] It wasn't!

313
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:57,165
You guys do realize we can still hear
everything you're saying, right?

314
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,624
[laughs]

315
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,042
[whispers] Conspiring.

316
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,003
-I told you, they're conspiring.
-[knock at door]

317
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,713
Not now, Mom!

318
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,465
[Nancy] Mike, open the door.

319
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,637
[Dustin] Code red, I repeat, code red.

320
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,014
Does anyone copy?

321
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,683
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.

322
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,353
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.
Does anyone copy?

323
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,148
We are innocent children
and we are trapped under Starcourt Mall.

324
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,234
The Red Army has infiltrated Hawkins,
and if we are found,

325
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,903
they will torture and kill us.

326
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,029
[Steve] Hey. [grunts]

327
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,364
Gotta take it easy on that thing.
Gonna drain the battery.

328
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,033
-The mall just opened.
-So?

329
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,576
So someone could be in range.

330
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,412
What do you think, Petey the Mall Cop
is gonna rappel down here

331
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,497
and save the day?

332
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,207
All right, why are you such a cranky pants

333
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,167
after getting to spend the night
with Robin?

334
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,002
Shh! Jesus Christ.

335
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,338
Will you just give up
on your creepy dream already?

336
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,881
I heard you guys talking all night.

337
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,050
We were trying to figure out a way
to open up the door

338
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,760
while you children were sleeping.

339
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,178
After eight hours,

340
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,555
we're still exactly nowhere, which is,

341
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,475
you know, probably just a little bit
of the reason why I'm feeling just...

342
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,393
-a tad cranky.
-[unzipping sound]

343
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,436
What are you doing?

344
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,565
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm taking a leak. Look away.

345
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,650
Look away!

346
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,609
[Steve's voice echoes]

347
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,777
[scoffs]

348
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,160
Can you redirect your stream, please?

349
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,620
[Robin's voice echoes]

350
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,665
Ugh.

351
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,419
Hey, hey! Be careful, careful, careful!

352
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,754
We don't even know what that is.

353
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,381
Exactly. It could be useful.

354
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,840
Useful how?

355
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,176
We can survive down here a long time
without food,

356
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,388
but if the human body doesn't get water,
it will die.

357
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,764
I hate to break it to you,

358
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,600
but<i> this</i> is not water.

359
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,102
No, but it's a liquid,

360
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,979
and if it comes down to me
drinking that shit

361
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,397
or dying of thirst,

362
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,523
I drink.

363
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,440

364
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,110
[distant electronic whirring]

365
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,491
We've got company.

[sniffing]

371
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,268
[in Russian] You smell that?

372
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,811
[in Russian] What?

373
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,063
Piss.

374
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,149

[Steve grunts]

377
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,390
Let's go.

378
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,269
-Go. Go, go, go, go, go.
-[Erica] I'm going!

379
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,105
-Henderson. Go, go.
-[vial buckles]

380
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,319
[Robin] Come on, Steve, let's go!

381
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,865
[sizzling]

382
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,993
-Jesus Christ.
-[Erica] Ooh!

383
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,539
You still wanna drink that?

384
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,752
Holy mother of God.

385
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,339
Well...

386
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,466
hope you guys are in good shape.

387
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,386
Looking at you, roast beef.

388
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,348
Let's go, come on.

389
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,725
Why me?

390
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,190
It was the same thing,

391
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,234
the exact same thing
that happened to Will last year.

392
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,861
And look at this.
Look at the body temperatures.

393
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,823
He likes it cold.

394
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,826
Okay, so this crazy old woman
who was eating fertilizer--

395
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,703
-Mrs. Driscoll.
-Right, yeah, Mrs. Driscoll.

396
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,413
-What time was this attack?
-Last night.

397
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:06,872
Right, but what time last night?

398
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,958
-Around 9:00.
-You waited all night to call?

399
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,085
I was waiting for the doctors
to run some tests.

400
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,253
You weren't there?

401
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,629
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

402
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,588
Hallelujah!

403
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:15,506
Ooh.

404
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,926
Um, so, wha-- what time was your...
sauna test?

405
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,052
[in unison] Around 9:00.

406
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,222
Well, that proves it.
That proves my theory.

407
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,682
She's flayed, just like Billy.

408
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,101
-Flayed?
-The Mind Flayer. He flays people.

409
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,185
Takes over their mind.

410
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,479
Once they do that,
they basically become him.

411
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,149
-If there are two flayed--
-We have to assume there are more.

412
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,316
Heather.

413
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,695
Billy was doing something to her.

414
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,280
[Heather whimpers echo]

415
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,823
She was scared.

416
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:42,783
She was screaming.

417
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,453
-[screams]
-Bad screams.

418
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,954
-What's a good scream?
-Max said--

419
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,957
-Doesn't matter.
-I'm sorry, I'm lost. Who is Heather?

420
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,543
-She's a lifeguard at the pool.
-Heather Holloway?

421
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:54,670
[both] Tom.

422
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,178
[car doors shut]

423
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,054
Seriously?

424
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,723
Welcome to my world.

425

[Mike scoffs]

426
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,518

[insects buzzing]

429
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,033
-Oh, my God. Can you not walk so close?
-What?

430
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,452
Can you not walk so close to me?
You stink.

431
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,829
[Hopper laughs]

432
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,122
I get it, I get it. You're upset, right?

433
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,916
'Cause I, uh... I blew up the car?

434
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,251
Yeah, with me in it.

435
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,711
Well, I just want to remind you
of something, Joyce.

436
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,130
-I am not a mechanic.
-Yeah, clearly.

437
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,882
That's why you should've listened
to Alexei.

438
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,343
Oh, right, yeah.
Your new boyfriend, right?

439
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,763
Yes. Every man I talk to from now on
has to be my boyfriend.

440
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,057
Yeah, he reminds me a bit
of a Russian Scott Clarke.

441
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,183
Oh, here we go.

442
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,478
Maybe you should go on a date.
I don't know, I'm thinking, like, Enzo's?

443
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,272
-Whoa.
-What?

444
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,314
He's running.

445
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,276
[Alexei whimpers, grunts]

446
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,777

So, what are you,
some kinda bounty hunter?

461
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,207
I'm a cop.

462
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,793
I'm undercover.

Oh, hey, Karen, it's Joyce.

Yeah, I-- I'm just checking on Will.

At the movies?

468
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,021
Just keep your mouth shut, all right?

[slurping loudly]

470
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,778
All right, all right, hop in.
Come on, get in.

00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,029
-Hey!
-Hey!

472
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,822
You "hey!" You "hey!"

473
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,200
This is a police emergency, all right?

474
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,370
I need to commandeer your vehicle.

475
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:15,829
What?

476
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,123
As long as there's a... a...

477
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,458
[Hopper] What is your name, sir?

478
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,001
-Todd.
-Todd?

479
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,252
-Yeah.
-Todd.

480
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,921
-Todd.
-Todd...

481
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:25,798
listen to me.

482
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,508
That man in there,

483
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,134
I know he doesn't look it,

484
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:33,097
but he is one of the most dangerous men
in the world.

485
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,808
He's, uh...

486
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,311
-murdered many children.
-What?

487
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,064
Yeah, he's a true psychopath.
I tracked him over two state lines.

488
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,273
[Joyce] Hey, what's going on?

489
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,900
Ah, Detective Byers.

490
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:45,859
Uh...

491
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,194
this is Todd.

492
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:52,157
He's agreed to... lend us his vehicle
to transport our dangerous criminal.

493
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,827
Oh, yes, he-- very dangerous, uh,

494
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,786
forger... er.

495
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,705
Yeah. Uh, child murderer.

496
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,707
-Child murderer?
-We should really get going.

497
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,958
Hey, how do I get my car back?

498
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,793
-You just call the station.
-What station?

499
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,421
-[heavy metal resumes]
-Ooh, I like the sound of that, Todd!

500
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,505
Hey, what station?

501
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,257
You're doing the right thing!

502
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,342
[tires squealing]

503
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,302
Hey, what the... Hey!

504
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,139
Dude!

505
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,937
[Dustin] I mean, you have to admit,
as a feat of engineering alone,

506
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,355
this is impressive.

507
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,482
What are you talking about?
It's a total fire hazard.

508
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,026
There's no stairs, there's no exit,

509
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,236
there's just an elevator
that drops you halfway to hell.

510
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,154
They're Commies.

511
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,614
You don't pay people, they cut corners.

512
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,991
To be fair to our Russian comrades,

513
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,410
I don't think this tunnel was designed
for walking.

514
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,495
Think about it,
they developed the perfect system

515
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:39,663
for transporting that cargo.

516
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,749
It all comes into the mall
like any old delivery.

517
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,376
And then they load it up onto those trucks
and nobody's the wiser.

518
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,878
[Steve] You think
they built this whole mall

519
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,172
so they could transport
that green poison?

520
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,716
I very seriously doubt
it's something as boring as poison.

521
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,968
It's gotta be much more valuable,
like promethium or something.

522
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,344
What the hell is promethium?

523
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:57,890
It's what Victor Stone's dad used to make
Cyborg's bionic and cybernetic components.

524
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,851
You're all so nerdy,
it makes me physically ill.

525
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,561
No, no, no.
No, don't lump me in with them.

526
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,687
I'm not a nerd, all right?

527
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,439
[Robin] Why so sensitive, Harrington?

528
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,524
Afraid of losing cool points
to a ten-year-old child?

529
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,235
No, I'm just saying I don't know jack shit
about Prometheus.

530
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,153
[Dustin] Promethium.

531
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,740
Prometheus is a Greek mythological figure,
but whatever. All I'm saying is,

532
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,825
it's probably being used
to make something.

533
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,160
