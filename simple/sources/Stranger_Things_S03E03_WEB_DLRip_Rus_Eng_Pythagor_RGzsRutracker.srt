00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,538
-You slipped on this, remember?
-Yeah.

187
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,624
Yeah, it fell in the night.
It lost its magnetism.

188
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,126
-Oh, did it?
-And the same exact thing happened

189
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,003
at my house the day before.

190
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,172
-Wow.
-And I thought, "Okay, that's weird."

191
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,425
Right? Why are all these magnets
suddenly losing their magnetism?

192
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,385
-Uh-huh?
-So, I went and saw Scott.

193
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,678
Scott.

194
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:56,763
Who's Scott?

195
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,349
-Scott Clarke.
-Your child's science teacher?

196
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,559
He's pretty brilliant, actually.

197
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,603
And I asked him, "How is this happening?"

198
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:08,316
And he built this magnetic field
using an AC transformer

199
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,235
and plugging it into a solenoid.

200
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,695
And-- And with that solenoid,
which basically--

201
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,988
Slow down, slow down.

202
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,324
I just want to get this exactly right,
okay?

203
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,451
You stand me up...

204
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,287
-[sighs]
-...no phone call, no apology,

205
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:25,625
because you had to go
to Scott Clarke's house.

206
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,960
Yeah.

207
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,795
[scoffs]

208
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,505
[chuckles]

209
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,008
You've outdone yourself, Joyce.

210
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,678
You really have.
No, you've outdone yourself.

211
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,556
Oh, come on, Hop,
you're not even listening to me.

212
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,809
Scott was able to demagnetize
some of the magnets, and he thinks--

213
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,310
I don't care what Scott thinks!

214
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:49,357
He thinks that a large-scale
magnetic field could be built

215
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,986
using some sort of machine
or-- or experimental technology.

216
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,404
He's brilliant, isn't he?

217
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,323
He's really brilliant. Is he single too?

218
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,491
[scoffs]

219
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,910
What if it's them?

220
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,832
To build a machine like this,
you need resources.

221
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,334
You need scientists, you need funding,

222
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,170
-tens of millions of dollars.
-Joyce.

223
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,755
It can't just be a coincidence, Hopper.

224
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:13,798
It has to be them.

225
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:14,841
Joyce, stop.

226
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,217
It has to be the lab.

227
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,427
It is impossible.

228
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,554
-Well, then, prove it to me.
-Prove it?

229
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,764
-Yeah, take me back there.
-To the lab.

230
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:22,807
Yeah, I wanna go back.

231
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,893
Because some magnets
fell off your fridge.

232
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:25,810
Yes.

233
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,313
Okay, makes sense.

234
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,981
[scoffs] Thank you.

235
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,649
It makes sense.

236
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,567
I'm sorry.

237
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,237
I'm a little busy right now,
bu<i>t </i>maybe we can<i> </i>meet up there,

238
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,072
like tonight, like seven o'clock?

239
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,783
You know, of course,
unless something comes up

240
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,620
-which, you know, it will.
-You know,

241
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,539
after everything that's happened,

242
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,082
this is no joke.

243
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,460
[Hopper] No, I don't think it's a joke.

244
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,255
I think that when I asked you out,
I think you got scared.

245
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,635
I think you got scared, and now,
you're inventing things.

246
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,137
You're inventing things
to get worked up about

247
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,098
so that you can push me away.

248
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,559
Because God forbid

00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,144

00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,562
move on!

251
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,439
Because that...

252
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,775
that would be...

253
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,195
[chuckles] I mean, that would be
too much, right, Joyce?

254
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:18,905
You know?

255
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,866
That would be too much,
wouldn't it, Joyce?

256
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,703
Wouldn't it, Joyce?

Joyce!

260
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,678
-What the hell are you doing?
-I need to borrow these.

261
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,554
No, you're not going back there.

262
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,056

00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,184

We should be at the mall
or, like, watching a movie or something.

268
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,823
You don't believe me?

269
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,201
I believe you saw some
super weird stuff, totally,

270
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,997
but you said Mike has
sensed you in there before, right?

271
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,917
So maybe it was just like that.
Maybe Billy just...

272
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,627
sensed you somehow.

273
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,881
-But the screams.
-Yeah, I know, but here's the thing.

274
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,051
When Billy is alone with a girl,

275
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,595
they make, like, really crazy noises.

276
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,724
-They scream?
-Yeah, but, like... happy screams.

277
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,518
-Happy screams? What is happy screams?
-It's like...

278
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,438
I'm just gonna lend you
my mom's <i>Cosmo.</i>

You really want to do this?

Why do I get the feeling we're gonna find
all kinds of wrong in here?

Okay.

So, what exactly are we looking at here?
Is this the Driscoll lady's stuff?

301

No. No, see, that's the thing. I mean,

And it's not just fertilizer.

It's pesticides, cleaning supplies,
diesel fuel.

And that's just from one day
of calling around. I mean...

[Steve] Anna Jacobi's talking
with that meathead Mark Lewinsky.

361
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,197
If you're not gonna focus,
just gimme the binoculars.

362
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,366
Aw, Jesus Christ,
whatever happened to standards?

363
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,077
[Steve] I mean,
Lewinsky never even came off the bench.

364
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,621
Dude, you are the worst spy in history,
you know that?

365
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,665
-Stop, hey. Stop.
-Give me those.

366
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,127
I don't get why you're looking at girls.
You have the perfect one in front of you.

367
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,588
-Seriously, if you say Robin again--
-Robin.

368
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,548
-No, don't. No.
-Robin, Robin, Robin.

369
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,924
-Stop, no, no, no.
-Robin. Robin.

370
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:12,842
-Robin.
-No.

371
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,759
-Robin.
-No!

372
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,344
No, man, she's not my type.

373
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,512
She's not even...

374
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,473
in the ballpark of what my type is,
all right?

375
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,809
What's your type again? Not awesome?

376
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,020
-Thank you.
-Hm.

377
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,231
For your information,
she's still in school. And she's weird.

378
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,233
She's a weirdo. And she's hyper.

379
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,651
I don't like that she's hyper.

380
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,987
And she did drama.
That's a bad look.

381
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,322
And she's in band?

382
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,366
-No.
-Now that you're out of high school,

383
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,828
which means you're technically an adult,
don't you think it's time you move on

384
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,872
from primitive constructs
such as popularity?

385
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,625
Oh, primitive constructs? That some
stupid shit you learned at Camp...

386
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,959
Know... Nothing?

387
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,169
Camp Know Where, actually.

388
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,046
-And no, it's shit I learned from life.
-Hm.

389
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,548
Instead of dating somebody
you think's gonna make you cooler,

390
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,967
why not date somebody you actually enjoy
being around?

391
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,302
Like me and Suzie.

392
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,345
Oh, Suzie.

393
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,680
Yeah, you mean,
"hotter than Phoebe Cates."

394
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:00,806
Yeah, that Suzie.

395
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,184
And, uh, let's think about

396
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,562
how exactly did you score
that beautiful girlfriend?

397
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,065
Oh, yeah. With my advice.

398
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,692
Because that's how this works, Henderson.

399
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,862
I give you the advice, you follow through.

400
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,906
Not the other way around,
all right, pea-brain?

401
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,284
[thunder rumbling]

402
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,705
[Will] Do you guys hear that?

403
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,541
It sounds like... thunder.

404
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,626
[orchestral march playing]

405
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,587
But, no, wait. That's not thunder.

406
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,797
It's...

407
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,965
a horde of juju zombies!

408
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,759
Sir Mike, your action.

409
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,511
What should I do?

410
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,262
Attack?

411
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,181
Okay, I attack with my flail.

412
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,808
-[rolls dice]
-Whoosh!

413
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,059
You miss.

414
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,354
Your flail clanks the stone, the zombie
horde lumbers towards you, and...

415
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,066
the juju bites your arm. Flesh tears!

416
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,109
Aah!

417
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,652
Seven points of damage.

418
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,070
[sarcastically] Oh, no, my arm.

419
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,531
-Lucas, look, my arm.
-[snickers]

420
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,535
Sir Lucas, the zombie horde roars!

421
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,329
Do you fight back or do you run?

422
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,332
[phone ringing]

423
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,750
No! It's a distraction!

424
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,002
A trap. Do not answer it.

425
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,172
What... No!

426
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,924
El?

427
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:17,967
[Mike] No.

428
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,802
Sorry, not interested.

429
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,721
Telemarketers.

430
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,514
Maybe we should just call them.

431
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:24,932
We can do that?

432
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,059
-I think so.
-Yeah, but what would we say?

433
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,729
We'll say nothing! The Khuisar tribe
still needs your help.

434
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:30,938
All right, then.

435
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,275
I'll use my torch to set fire
to the chambers, sacrificing ourselves,

436
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,360
killing the jujus, and saving the Khuisar.

437
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,196
We all live on as heroes
in the memories of the Kalamar.

438
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,614
Victory.

439
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,867
Okay. Fine.

440
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,910
-You guys win.
-[music stops]

441
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,121
-Congratulations.
-Will, I was just messing around.

442
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,040
Hey, let's finish for real.

443
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,585
-How much longer is the campaign?
-Just forget it, Mike.

444
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,545
No, you want to keep playing, right?

445
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,338
Y-Yeah, totally.

446
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,425
-We'll just call the girls afterwards.
-I said forget it, Mike, okay?

447
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,802
-I'm going home.
-But...

448
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,471
-Come on, Will.
-Move!

449
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,517
[sighs]

450
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,437
[Mike] Will, come on.

451
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,105
You can't leave. It's raining.

452
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,149
Listen, I said I was sorry, all right?

453
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,902
It's a cool campaign. It's really cool.

454
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,905
-We're just not in the mood right now.
-Yeah, Mike. That's the problem.

455
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,573
You guys are never in the mood anymore.

456
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,867
-You're ruining our party.
-That's not true.

457
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,952
Really? Where's Dustin right now?

458
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,830
See? You don't know
and you don't even care.

459
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,957
And obviously he doesn't either
and I don't blame him.

460
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,043
You're destroying everything,
and for what?

461
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,128
So you can swap spit
with some stupid girl?

462
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,129
El's not stupid.

463
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,131
It's not my fault you don't like girls.

464
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,384
[thunder rumbling]

465
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,305
I'm not trying to be a jerk. Okay?

466
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,307
But we're not kids anymore.

467
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,476
I mean, what did you think, really?

468
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,853
That we were never gonna get girlfriends?

469
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,730
We were just gonna sit
in my basement all day

470
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,482
and play games for the rest of our lives?

471
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:57,900
Yeah.

472
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:58,943
[sniffles]

473
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,152
I guess I did.

474
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,363
I really did.

475
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:05,699
Will.

476
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,201
Will!

477
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,161
Will, come on!

478
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,668
[indistinct chatter]

479
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,630

[thunder rumbling]

482
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:29,515
Excuse me.

483
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,310
No one in the water
until 30 minutes after the last strike.

484
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,145
And don't try and argue with me.

485
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,273
You wanna get electrocuted,
go climb a tree.

486
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,316
Yeah, we don't care.
We're not here to swim.

487
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,026
Or get electrocuted.

488
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,028
We found this.

489
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,448
Does that belong to anybody?

490
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,867
Oh, yeah.

491
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,535
That's Heather's.

492
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,578
I'll get it back to her.

493
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,122
We could give it back to her.

494
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,123
You could.

495
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,958
'Cept she's not here.

496
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,626
Bailed on me today.

497
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,713
What is this?

498
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,340
You girls want a reward or somethin'?

499
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:04,842
No.

500
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,051
We're just...

501
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:07,928
Good Samaritans.

502
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,360
[Max] Heather.

503
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,113
Do you think you can find her?

504
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:27,990

What do you see?

508
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,673
A door.

509
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,258

You okay?

533
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,050
I'm fine.

534
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,095
You want to wait in the car?

535
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:37,763
